# Radar_Processing [Python, R] scripts
Processing weather radar data in two fronts:
- In Python:
  - Calculate hydrometeor classification (using [`CSU_RadarTools`](https://github.com/CSU-Radarmet/CSU_RadarTools)) and plot with polarimetric variables
  - Plot PPIs of single-pol variables
- In R:
  - Read and view CAPPI data (specially from SÃ£o Roque radar)
