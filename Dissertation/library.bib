abstract = {Abstract. The dominant hydrometeor types associated with Brazilian tropical precipitation systems are identified via research X-band dual-polarization radar deployed in the vicinity of the Manaus region (Amazonas) during both the GoAmazon2014/5 and ACRIDICON-CHUVA field experiments. The present study is based on an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) approach that makes use of dual polarimetric radar observables (reflectivity at horizontal polarization ZH, differential reflectivity ZDR, specific differential phase KDP, and correlation coefficient $\rho$HV) and temperature data inferred from sounding balloons. The sensitivity of the agglomerative clustering scheme for measuring the inter-cluster dissimilarities (linkage criterion) is evaluated through the wet season dataset. Both the weighted and Ward linkages exhibit better abilities to retrieve cloud microphysical species, whereas clustering outputs associated with the centroid linkage are poorly defined. The AHC method is then applied to investigate the microphysical structure of both the wet and dry seasons. The stratiform regions are composed of five hydrometeor classes: drizzle, rain, wet snow, aggregates, and ice crystals, whereas convective echoes are generally associated with light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, graupels, aggregates and ice crystals. The main discrepancy between the wet and dry seasons is the presence of both low- and high-density graupels within convective regions, whereas the rainy period exhibits only one type of graupel. Finally, aggregate and ice crystal hydrometeors in the tropics are found to exhibit higher polarimetric values compared to those at mid-latitudes.},

abstract = {The present study makes use of cloud-to-ground lightning, three-dimensional mapping from a Lightning Mapping Array and Doppler C-band radar observations to analyze the lightning trends and the underlying electrical charge structure of a large-hail bearing storm that produced important damages on the local agriculture. The analysis reported an extremely active storm, evolving through distinct phases, which stood out from a multicell structure to finally become a supercell. The onset of newer regions of convective development interacting with the main cell made the charge structure to be rather complex during some stages of this long-lived hailstorm. Evidence suggests the presence of regions with the charge layer being inverted from that of normal, non-severe convective storms, producing predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The analysis also suggests that strong cloud signals were misclassified as low peak current single-stroke negative cloud-to-ground flashes, masking the predominant positive nature of the storm.},

abstract = {Despite the considerable damage potential related to severe hailstorms, knowledge about the local hail probability in Germany is very limited. Constructing a reliable hail probability map is challenging due largely to the lack of direct hail observations. In our study, we suggest a reasonable method by which to estimate hail signals from 3D radar reflectivity measured by conventional single-polarization radars between 2005 and 2011. Evaluating the radar-derived hail days with loss data from a building and an agricultural insurance company confirmed the reliability of the method and the results as expressed, for example, by a Heidke Skill Score HSS of 0.7.Overall, radar-derived hail days demonstrate very high spatial variability, which reflects the local-scale nature of deep moist convection. Nonetheless, systematic patterns related to climatic conditions and orography can also be observed. On the large scale, the number of hail days substantially increases from north to south, which may plausibly be explained by the higher thermal instability in the south. At regional and local scales, several hot spots with elevated hail frequency can be identified, in most cases downstream of the mountains. Several other characteristics including convective energy related to the events identified, differences in track lengths, and seasonal cycles are discussed.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is anticipated to increase severe thunderstorm potential in North America, but the resulting changes in associated convective hazards are not well known. Here, using a novel modelling approach, we investigate the spatiotemporal changes in hail frequency and size between the present (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070). Although fewer hail days are expected over most areas in the future, an increase in the mean hail size is projected, with fewer small hail events and a shift toward a more frequent occurrence of larger hail. This leads to an anticipated increase in hail damage potential over most southern regions in spring, retreating to the higher latitudes (that is, north of 50[deg][thinsp]N) and the Rocky Mountains in the summer. In contrast, a dramatic decrease in hail frequency and damage potential is predicted over eastern and southeastern regions in spring and summer due to a significant increase in melting that mitigates gains in hail size from increased buoyancy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society. Hail is the costliest atmospheric hazard in Switzerland, causing substantial damage to agriculture, cars and buildings every year. In this study, a 12-year statistic of objectively identified cold fronts and a radar-based hail statistic are combined to investigate the co-occurrence of cold fronts and hail in Switzerland. In a first step, an automated front identification scheme, which has previously been designed for and applied to global reanalysis data, is modified for a high-resolution regional analysis data set. This front detection method is then adapted, tested and applied to the Consortium for Small Scale Modelling (COSMO) analysis data for the extended hail season (May to September) in the years 2002-2013. The resulting cold front statistic is presented and discussed. In a second step, the frequency of cold fronts is linked to a high-resolution radar-based hail statistic to determine the relative fraction of hail initiation events in pre-frontal environments. Up to 45% of all detected hail events in north-eastern and southern Switzerland form in pre-frontal zones. Similar fractions are identified upstream of the Jura and the Black Forest mountains. The percentage of front-related hail formation is highest in regions where hail is statistically less frequent, with the exception of southern Switzerland. Furthermore, it is shown that fronts create wind-sheared environments, which are favourable for hail cells.},

The radar history of 195 strong convective cells is studied and compared with information of a dense hailpad network (323 pads per 1292 km2). It is found that all hail-bearing cells are detected early in their development. About 50% of the 71 cells which met the seeding criterion never produced hail on the ground. This corresponds to a 30% waste of seeding rockets. The criterion which uses six radar parameters can be replaced by a simpler and slightly more efficient criterion which necessitates only the determination of the height of the 45 dBZ contour H45 in relation to the melting level H0. The new criterion is compared with other criteria and its microphysical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Aerosols that act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play a crucial role in the formation of cloud particles and recent research suggests that CCN can influence ice processes within deep convection as well. In this study, a triple-moment bulk hail microphysics scheme is used to investigate the impact of changing CCN concentrations on hail for a well-observed supercell storm that occurred over northwest Kansas on 29 June 2000 during the Severe Thunderstorm and Electrification and Precipitation Study (STEPS). For the simulated supercells in the particular environment examined, an increase in potential CCN concentrations from 100 to 3000cm-3leads to increasing numbers and decreasing sizes of cloud droplets, as expected, yet the overall storm dynamics and evolution are largely unaffected. Increases in potential CCN concentrations lead to non-monotonic responses in the bulk characteristics of nearly all hydrometeor fields, surface precipitation, and cold-pool strength. However, higher concentrations of CCN also result in larger hail sizes and greater amounts of large diameter (≥2cm) hail. The results suggest that a combination of increased sizes and localized reductions in numbers of hail embryos near favorable growth regions with increasing potential CCN concentrations tend to promote conditions that lead to increased hail sizes and amounts of large hail. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This impact has lead to a growing body of research and insight into these events. In this article, the state of knowledge regarding their incidence, distribution, and the resulting hail, tornado, convective wind, and lightning risk will be reviewed. Applying this assessment of knowledge, the implications for forecasting, the warning process, and how these events may respond to climate change and variability will also be discussed. Based on this review, ongoing work in the field is outlined, and several potential avenues for future research and exploration are suggested. Most notably, the need for improved observational or proxy climatologies, the forecasting guidelines for tornadoes, and the need for a greater understanding of how severe thunderstorms respond to climate variability are highlighted.},

To remove the bias from increasingly detected losses over time due to newly built-up locations, only large events that incurred normalized losses of at least $250 million (U.S. dollars) economically ($150 million insured) were selected. These are multistate damage events that are unlikely to have been missed at any time within the analysis period, thus providing for homogeneity of the events covered.

abstract = {Observations and recent high-resolution numerical model simulations indicate that liquid water and partially frozen hydrometeors can be lofted considerably above the environmental 0 degree C level in the updrafts of convective storms owing to the warm thermal perturbation from latent heating within the updraft and to the noninstantaneous nature of drop freezing. Consequently, upward extensions of positive differential reflectivity (i.e., ZDR equal or greater than 1 dB)—called ZDR columns—may be a useful proxy for detecting the initiation of new convective storms and examining the evolution of convective storm updrafts. High-resolution numerical simulations with spectral bin microphysics and a polarimetric forward operator reveal a strong spatial association between updrafts and ZDR columns and show the utility of examining the structure and evolution of ZDR columns for assessing updraft evolution. This paper introduces an automated ZDR column algorithm designed to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information pertinent to convective storm nowcasting. Although suboptimal vertical resolution above the 0 degree C level and limitations imposed by commonly used scanning strategies in the operational WSR-88D network can complicate ZDR column detection, examples provided herein show that the algorithm can provide operational and research-focused meteorologists with valuable information about the evolution of convective storms.},

abstract = {The low levels of supercell forward flanks commonly exhibit distinct differential reflectivity (Z DR) signa-tures, including the low-Z DR hail signature and the high-Z DR ''arc.'' The Z DR arc has been previously as-sociated with size sorting of raindrops in the presence of vertical wind shear; here this model is extended to include size sorting of hail. Idealized simulations of a supercell storm observed by the Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), polarimetric radar on 1 June 2008 are performed using a multimoment bulk microphysics scheme, in which size sorting is allowed or disallowed for hydrometeor species. Several velocity–diameter relation-ships for the hail fall speed are considered, as well as fixed or variable bulk densities that span the graupel-to-hail spectrum. A T-matrix-based emulator is used to derive polarimetric fields from the hydrometeor state variables. Size sorting of hail is found to have a dominant impact on Z DR and can result in a Z DR arc from melting hail even when size sorting is disallowed in the rain field. The low-Z DR hail core only appears when size sorting is allowed for hail. The mean storm-relative wind in a deep layer is found to align closely with the gradient in mean mass diameter of both rain and hail, with a slight shift toward the storm-relative mean wind below the melting level in the case of rain. The best comparison with the observed 1 June 2008 supercell is obtained when both rain and hail are allowed to sort, and the bulk density and associated fall-speed curve for hail are predicted by the model microphysics.},

abstract = {Several studies reported sudden increases in the total lightning flash rate (intra-cloud+cloud-to-ground) preceding the occurrence of severe weather (large hail, wind gusts associated to thunderstorms and/or tornadoes). Named “Lightning Jump”, this pattern has demonstrated to be of operational applicability in the forecasting of severe weather phenomena. The present study introduces the application of a lightning jump algorithm, with an identification of cells based solely on total lightning data, revealing that there is no need of radar data to trigger severe weather warnings. The algorithm was validated by means of a dataset severe weather events occurred in Catalonia in the period 2009–2014. Results obtained revealed very promising.},

abstract = {Hail processes in deep convection can have a substantial impact on precipitation characteristics as well as on dynamic and thermodynamic properties of convective downdrafts and cold pools, yet the realistic representation of hail in many cloud-resolving models employing bulk microphysical schemes is challenging. The limits imposed by fixing one or two of the distribution parameters in many one- and two-moment bulk microphysics schemes often lead to particularly poor representations of particles within the tails of size distribution spectra; an especially important consideration for hail, which covers a broad range of sizes in nature. In order to improve the representation of hail distributions in simulations of deep moist convection in cloud-resolving numerical models, a new triple-moment bulk hail microphysics scheme (3MHAIL) is presented and evaluated. The 3MHAIL scheme predicts the relative dispersion parameter for a gamma distribution function via prognostication of the sixth moment (related to the reflectivity factor) of the distribution in addition to the mass mixing ratio and number concentration (third and zeroeth moments, respectively) thereby allowing for a fully prognostic distribution function. Significant improvement in the representation of sedimentation, melting, and formation processes of hail are achieved with the 3MHAIL scheme compared to lower-order moment schemes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Mahale2016,
abstract = {On 14 June 2011, thunderstorms developed along a cold front in central Oklahoma in a thermodynamic environment that was conducive for downbursts. One of the thunderstorms produced a wet downburst in Norman, Oklahoma, that resulted in surface winds in excess of 35 m s21 (.80 mi h21 ) and hailstones in excess of 4 cm in diameter. Unique 1-min observations of the downburst were recorded by an Oklahoma Mesonet station. These observations indicated a 6.6-hPa pressure rise that was coincident with a rain rate of 213 mm h21 at the center of the downburst. In this event, both the research KOUN (Norman) and operational KTLX (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) instruments were scanning this downburst and its parent storm at close range (,30 km). KOUN provided polarimetric radar data (PRD) while both radars provided limited dualDoppler coverage. The evolution of the downburst is analyzed mostly through the use of reconstructed range–height indicators of the PRD. A hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA) is applied to the PRD to gain further understanding of the microphysical evolution of the downburst. Through the analyses, it is seen that graupel aloft made a transition to a nearly all rain and hail mixture above the 08C level. This large area of mixed rain and hail eventually descended to the ground, causing the downburst. In this study, the HCA analyses are utilized to develop a conceptual model that characterizes the hydrometeor evolution of the parent downburst storm.},

abstract = {On 5 September 2015 a violent hailstorm hit the Gulf and the city of Naples in Italy. The storm originated over the Tyrrhenian Sea dropping 7–10 cm diameter hailstones along its path. During its mature phase, at 08:47 UTC, the hailstorm was captured by one overpass of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission Core Observatory (GPM-CO) embarking the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and the Ka/Ku-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). In this paper, observations by both GMI and DPR are thoroughly analyzed in conjunction with other spaceborne and ground-based measurements, to show how the GPM-CO integrates established observational tools in monitoring, understanding, and characterizing severe weather. Rapid-scan MSG SEVIRI images show an extremely rapid development, with 10.8 $\mu$m cloud-top temperatures dropping by 65 K in 40 min down to 198 K. The LIghtning NETwork registered over 37,000 strokes in 5 h, with intracloud positive stroke fraction increasing during the regeneration phases, when ground-based polarimetric radar and DPR support the presence of large graupel/hail particles. DPR Ku 40 dBZ and 20 dBZ echo top heights at 14 km and 16 km, respectively, indicate strong updraft and deep overshooting. GMI extremely low brightness temperatures (TBs) in correspondence of the convective core (158, 97, 67, and 87 K at 18.7, 36.5, 89 and 166 GHz) are compatible with the presence of massive ice particles. In two years of GPM global observations the storm ranks as fourth and first in terms of minimum 36.5 and 18.7 GHz (V-pol) TBs, respectively. This study illustrates GPM-CO sensing capabilities for characterizing the structure of such severe hailstorm, while providing observational evidence of its intensity and rarity, both globally and over the Mediterranean area.},

abstract = {A statistical model for the occurrence of convective hazards was developed and applied to reanalysis data to detect multidecadal trends in hazard frequency. The modeling framework is based on an additive logistic regression for observed hazards that exploits predictors derived from numerical model data. The regression predicts the probability of a severe hazard, which is considered as a product of two components: the probability that a storm occurs and the probability of the severe hazard, given the presence of a storm [P(severe) = P(storm) ? P(severe|storm)]. The model was developed using lightning data as an indication of thunderstorm occurrence and hazard reports across central Europe. Although it uses only two predictors per component, it is capable of reproducing the observed spatial distribution of lightning and yields realistic annual cycles of lightning, hail, and wind fairly accurately. The model was applied to ERA-Interim (1979?2016) across Europe to detect any changes in lightning, hail, and wind hazard occurrence. The frequency of conditions favoring lightning, wind, and large hail has increased across large parts of Europe, with the exception of the southwest. The resulting predicted occurrence of 6-hourly periods with lightning, wind, and large hail has increased by 16%, 29%, and 41%, respectively, across western and central Europe and by 23%, 56%, and 86% across Germany and the Alps during the period considered. It is shown that these changes are caused by increased instability in the reanalysis rather than by changes in midtropospheric moisture or wind shear.},

Lightning observations reveal that 97% of flash initiation and 93% of flash propagation occurred within the convective region. Through combining LMA and radar-derived microphysical data it is also shown that lightning initiation events and propagation mostly occurred in regions containing graupel (initiation = 70%, propagation = 58%), ice (initiation = 22%, propagation = 33%), and to a lesser extent hail (initiation = 6%, propagation = 5%). The detailed analysis of the lightning activity during two periods of contrasted electrical activity suggests that wet hail growth processes and/or charge redistribution within the cloud may have had a negative impact on lightning initiation occurrences and propagation. The most active periods in terms of lightning activity occurred in conjunction with a vigorous, terrain driven, updraught that transported graupel particles above a height of 12 km.},

abstract = {The first climatic investigations of hail in North America were by Lemons and Flora during the 1940's. These were followed by more intensive, state-scale climatic investigations in the 1960's to meet insurance concerns. Subsequent concerns with hail by the aviation industry and the weather modification community led to the first collection of mesoscale hail data from dense networks and radar studies during the 1960's and 1970's. This paper is a review of available hail information presented in a series of time and space scales. Although the North American hail data and information are less than adequate, there is much more hail information than exists elsewhere in the world. Very extensive findings on hail are available for Alberta, Illinois and Colorado. Phenomenologically oriented studies have focused on hailstones, point hailfalls, hailstreaks, hailstorm, hailswaths and hail days over various sized areas. Results for each of these classifications are presented according to studies that focused on national, regional and small-scale areas. The principal hail area of the continent is in and to the lee of the Rocky, Mountains where hail is both frequent and intense; hence the Great Plains suffers great damages. Another high-frequency area related to spring storms extends from Texas to Michigan, but causes less crop damage since it largely precedes the crop season. Certain inexpensive data collection efforts and analyses which would greatly improve our knowledge of hail are recommended.},

abstract = {A database consisting of approximately 4000 storm observations has been objectively analyzed to determine environmental characteristics that produce high radar reflectivities above the freezing level, large total lightning flash rates on the order of 10 flashes per minute, and anomalous vertical charge structures (most notably, dominant midlevel positive charge). The storm database is drawn from four regions of the United States featuring distinct environments, each with coinciding Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) network data. LMAs are able to infer total lightning flash rates using flash clustering algorithms, such as the one implemented in this study. Results show that anomalous charge structures inferred from LMA data, significant lightning flash rates, and increased radar reflectivities above the freezing level tend to be associated with environments that have high cloud base heights (approximately 3 km above ground level) and large atmospheric instability, quantified by normalized convective available potential energy (NCAPE) near 0.2 m s−2. Additionally, we infer that aerosols may affect storm intensity. Maximum flash rates were observed in storms with attributed aerosol concentrations near 1000 cm−3, while total flash rates decrease when aerosol concentrations exceed 1500 cm−3, consistent with previous studies. However, this effect is more pronounced in regions where the NCAPE and cloud base height are low. The dearth of storms with estimated aerosol concentrations less than 700 cm−3 (approximately 1% of total sample) does not provide a complete depiction of aerosol invigoration.},

abstract = {Hail-day occurrences during a 100-yr period, 1896–1995, derived from carefully screened records of 66 first- order stations distributed across the United States, were assessed for temporal fluctuations and trends. Shorter- term (5- and 10-yr) fluctuations varied greatly and were often dissimilar between adjacent stations reflecting localized differences in hailstorm activity, making temporal interpretations difficult. But temporal fluctuations based on 20-yr and longer periods exhibited regional coherence reflecting the control of large-scale synoptic hail-producing systems on the point distributions over broader areas. Classification of station fluctuations based on 20-yr periods revealed five types of distributions existed across most of the nation. One present in the Midwest had a peak in hail activity in 1916–35 followed by a general decline to 1976–95. Another distribution had a midcentury peak and was found at stations in three areas: the central high plains, northern Rockies, and East Coast. The third distribution peaked during 1956–75 and was found at stations in the northern and south-central high plains. The fourth temporal distribution showed a steady increase during the 100-yr period, peaking in 1976–95, and was found in an area from the Pacific Northwest to the central Rockies and southern plains. The fifth distribution found at stations in the eastern Gulf Coast had a maximum at the beginning of the century and declined thereafter. The 100-yr linear trends defined four regions across the United States with significant up trends in the high plains, central Rockies, and southeast, but with decreasing trends elsewhere in the nation. These up trends have occurred in areas where hail damage is greatest, and the trends matched well with those defined by crop-hail insurance losses and those found in studies of thunderstorm trends. The national average based on all station hail values formed a bell-shaped 100-yr distribution with hail occurrences peaking in midcentury. Thunderstorm data from the 66 stations, also based on screening to ensure quality data, revealed a bell-shaped distribution similar to the hail-day distribution, and national hail insurance loss values have declined since the 1950s, also agreeing with the hail-day decrease since midcentury. The national distribution differs markedly from certain regional distributions illustrating the importance of using regional analysis to assess temporal fluctuations in severe weather conditions},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Royal Meteorological Society At the end of July 2013, a series of severe thunderstorms associated with heavy rainfall, severe wind gusts and large hail affected parts of Germany. On 28 July 2013, two supercells formed almost simultaneously in southern Germany, from which only the more southerly cell produced hailstones up to 10 cm in diameter on a hailswath approximately 120 km long and 15–20 km wide. For the insurance industry, this event, with losses of more than EUR 1 billion, was one of the most expensive natural disasters that has ever occurred in Germany. This article investigates the creation, temporal evolution and effects of the most severe supercell that day by considering and merging radar and satellite data, eyewitness reports, insurance loss data and numerical model studies. Observations of hail at ground level fit very well with a cold-ring-shaped structure in the cloud-top brightness temperature observed by a geostationary satellite imager. Various simulations conducted with the convection-permitting COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling (COSMO) revealed that the track of the hailstorm could be reproduced only when convection was triggered artificially by two warm bubbles that produced single cells that were precursors of the supercell. The model results suggested that the supercell developed near a pre-existing single cell through low-level flow convergence in an environment with moderate CAPE but substantial wind shear and storm-relative helicity, both of which persisted for several hours in the area in which the supercell moved.},

Currently, KNMI operates two Gematronik C-band Doppler radars which are performing low-elevation volume scans every 5 minutes and extensive vol- ume scans every 15 minutes. From the low-elevation volume scans, a “pseudo constant-altitude plan-position indicator” (pseudoCAPPI) of the radar reflectivity and an echotop product, which presents the maximum height of the echo for each pixel, are extracted. Ground clutter is re- moved from the pseudoCAPPI image using a statistical method (Wessels and Beekhuis, 1997). This report describes the development of the first new sub-product: a tool for the detection and display of summer hail. This hail detection product is to be used for nowcasting of the development and movement of summertime thunderstorms. In addition, an archive of this hail detection product could be a useful reference for e.g. insurance companies.},

abstract = {In the context of a warming climate, one of the variables currently under investigation is related to the detection of possible changes in hail precipitation. In this work, we analyze hail frequencies in one of the most affected areas by this phenomenon in Europe, southern France. Here, an extensive hail detection network has been in operation since 1988. In general, the detection of hailfall is very uncertain. To overcome the constraints of scarcity and poor standardization of hail detection and monitoring systems, some relationships between hailstorm occurrence and synoptic, mesoscale or thermodynamic atmospheric characteristics have been proposed in different areas. Therefore, we analyzed meteorological fields at synoptic scale that are related to the formation of hailstorms in the study area, i.e., geopotential height at 500 hPa, sea level pressure, and lapse-rate between 850 and 500 hPa. These fields describe the state of the atmosphere at low and mid levels, and facilitate the evaluation of thermal and dynamic instability. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen estimator, we examined trends in the three fields during the period 1948–2015 and their spatial patterns, revealing an evolution toward synoptic environments that favor hail precipitation in the Mediterranean region.},

abstract = {Abstract Ground-and radar-measured patterns of hail kinetic energy from eight hailstorms have been compared. The radar patterns were shifted horizontally in such a way that the correlation coefficient between the ground and radar data reaches a maximum. The correlation coefficients increased from .7 (no shift) to .9 (optimal shift) on average. The “optimal” shift vector is in good agreement with conceptual models about the kinematics of the storms. The influence of microphysical effects and of the storm dynamics on the agreement between the hailpad-and radar-measured quantities is discussed in detail. The melting of hailstones and the shape of hailstone spectra have been considered in additional analyses, and the impact of these effects on the ground and radar measurements could be isolated. The results imply that the melting of hailstones is more pronounced in supercell storms than in single-cell storms or in multicell storms.},

abstract = {Cloud condensation and ice nuclei in the troposphere are required precursors to cloud and precipitation formation, both of which influence the radiative balance of Earth. The initial stage of hailstone formation (i.e., the embryo) and the subsequent layered growth allow hail to be used as a model for the study of nucleation processes in precipitation. By virtue of the preserved particle and isotopic record captured by hailstones, they represent a unique form of precipitation that allows direct characterization of the particles present during atmospheric ice nucleation. Despite the ecological and economic consequences of hail storms, the dynamics of hailstone nucleation, and thus their formation, are not well understood. Our experiments show that hailstone embryos from three Rocky Mountain storms contained biological ice nuclei capable of freezing water at warm, subzero (°C) temperatures, indicating that biological particles can act as nucleation sites for hailstone formation. These results are corroborated by analysis of $\delta$D and $\delta$18O from melted hailstone embryos, which show that the hailstones formed at similarly warm temperatures in situ. Low densities of ice nucleation active abiotic particles were also present in hailstone embryos, but their low concentration indicates they were not likely to have catalyzed ice formation at the warm temperatures determined from water stable isotope analysis. Our study provides new data on ice nucleation occurring at the bottom of clouds, an atmospheric region whose processes are critical to global climate models but which has challenged instrument-based measurements.},

abstract = {The Tropics evoke romantic images of spectacular thunderstorms that tower above an aquamarine sea (Fig. 10.1). These impressive-looking cumulonimbi might lead one to believe that they also have vigorous circulations and thus have the potential to spawn severe weather. Surface station climatologies, satellite imagery, and lightning detection networks all demonstrate that the tropical landmasses have the highest frequency of deep convection in the world. Despite this high count, I will argue that all types of severe weather [tornadoes, hail with a diameter ≥ 20 mm (0.75 in.), and straight-line winds ≥ 26 m s−1 (50 knots or 93 km h−1)], save waterspouts, are rare over the tropical oceans and sporadic over tropical lands. Expansive regions of the Tropics are dominated by marginal conditional instability, dry midlevel air, and subsidence (e.g., the trades), while in the near-equatorial trough, the shear of the horizontal wind is weak, and the conditional instability, though it can reach high values, is spread through a deep troposphere, resulting in only modest updraft velocities. Severe local storms (SLS) thrive on the rapid juxtaposition of air with differing characteristics in the horizontal and especially the vertical. For much of the Tropics, trajectories over homogeneous warm seas erase these differences and soften the gradients conducive for SLS. Over the tropical continents, however, the conditions that favor SLS occur with greater frequency.},

abstract = {An enhanced hail detection algorithm (HDA) has been developed for the WSR-88D to replace the original hail algorithm. While the original hail algorithm simply indicated whether or not a detected storm cell was producing hail, the new HDA estimates the probability of hail (any size), probability of severe-size hail (diameter ≥19 mm), and maximum expected hail size for each detected storm cell. A new parameter, called the severe hail index (SHI), was developed as the primary predictor variable for severe-size hail. The SHI is a thermally weighted vertical integration of a storm cell's reflectivity profile. Initial testing on 10 storm days showed that the new HDA performed considerably better at predicting severe hail than the original hail algorithm. Additional testing of the new HDA on 31 storm days showed substantial regional variations in performance, with best results across the southern plains and weaker performance for regions farther east.},

abstract = {The Southeast Queensland (SEQ) region of Australia is recognised for frequent thunderstorms documented through numerous studies including high impact severe thunderstorm cases which have caused insured losses exceeding $1 billion AUD. Despite a modest body of scientific literature, basic questions regarding the role of climate, synoptic and local-scale (<10 km) processes affecting the variability of thunderstorms still remain. In an effort to advance these questions as part of the Coastal Convective Interactions Experiment (CCIE), this study integrates multiple datasets across an 18-year period (July 1997 – June 2015) to provide a mesoscale climatological analysis of the SEQ hailstorms and associated environmental conditions. On a multi-year time scale, the relationship between the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation and hailstorm frequency is consistent with previous studies. On synoptic scales, a southeasterly change situation coupled with a sea breeze was found to provide the most favourable environment for hailstorms, particularly for southwest SEQ. On the local-scale, hail development within convective cells was found to be most frequent within the inland limb of maritime air mass on sea breeze days. This observation suggests the sea breeze air masses may become favourable for convection after sufficient modification during inland propagation.},

abstract = {Damaging hailstorms are rare but are significant meteorological phenomena from the point of view of economic losses in central Europe. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of hail, the proper detection of hail occurrences is almost impossible using ground station reports alone. An alternate approach uses information from weather radars. Several algorithms that use single-polarisation radar data have been developed for hail detection. In the present study, seven algorithms were tested on well documented recent hail events from Czechia and southwest Germany from 2002 to 2011. The study aimed to find the optimal threshold values for the applications of these techniques over the Czech territory and for evaluating the climatology of hail events. The results showed that the Waldvogel technique and the NEXRAD severe hail algorithm were the most accurate methods for hail detection over the area of interest. A combined criterion was proposed based on a combination of previously tested techniques. The precision of this "combi-criterion" was demonstrated for a severe hail event. The abilities of the tested criteria to provide information about a hail-fall area distribution and hail damage risk over the Czech territory were shown and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

One common technique of reflectivity data assimilation is using a cloud analysis, which inserts temperature and moisture increments and hydrometeors deduced from radar reflectivity via empirical relations to induce and sustain updraft circulations. Polarimetric radar data have the ability to provide enhanced insight into the microphysical and dynamic structure of convection. Thus far, however, relatively little has been done to leverage these data for numerical weather prediction. In this study, the Advanced Regional Prediction System's cloud analysis is modified from its original reflectivity-based formulation to provide moisture and latent heat adjustments based on the detection of differential reflectivity columns, which can serve as proxies for updrafts in deep moist convection and, subsequently, areas of saturation and latent heat...},

The field program was built around two permanent facilities: the KOUN polarimetric radar and the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array. In addition, balloon-borne electric-field meters and radiosondes were launched together from a mobile laboratory to measure electric fields, winds, and standard thermodynamic parameters inside storms.

abstract = {Observations and recent high-resolution numerical model simulations indicate that liquid water and partially frozen hydrometeors can be lofted considerably above the environmental 0 degree C level in the updrafts of convective storms owing to the warm thermal perturbation from latent heating within the updraft and to the noninstantaneous nature of drop freezing. Consequently, upward extensions of positive differential reflectivity (i.e., ZDR equal or greater than 1 dB)—called ZDR columns—may be a useful proxy for detecting the initiation of new convective storms and examining the evolution of convective storm updrafts. High-resolution numerical simulations with spectral bin microphysics and a polarimetric forward operator reveal a strong spatial association between updrafts and ZDR columns and show the utility of examining the structure and evolution of ZDR columns for assessing updraft evolution. This paper introduces an automated ZDR column algorithm designed to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information pertinent to convective storm nowcasting. Although suboptimal vertical resolution above the 0 degree C level and limitations imposed by commonly used scanning strategies in the operational WSR-88D network can complicate ZDR column detection, examples provided herein show that the algorithm can provide operational and research-focused meteorologists with valuable information about the evolution of convective storms.},

A previous paper introduced the method and focused on the lifetime of patterns of rainfall rates and the scale dependence of predictability. This paper shows how the method of persistence of radar precipitation patterns can be extended to produce probabilistic forecasts. For many applications, probabilistic information is at least as important as the expected point value. Four techniques are presented and compared. One is entirely new and makes use of the intrinsic relationship between scale and predictability. The results with this technique suggest potential use for downscaling of numerical model output. For the 143 h of precipitation analyzed so far, roughly a factor of 2 was obtained between lead times of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. Three of the four techniques involve a scale parameter. The slope of the relationship between optimum scale and lead time is about 1 and 2 km min^-1 respectively. The skill scores obtained for the four techniques can be used as a measure of predictability in terms of probabilistic rainfall rates. The progress of other probabilistic forecasting methods, such as expert systems or numerical models, can be evaluated against the standard set by simple persistence. for Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques,},

abstract = {In the present study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate the features associated with a severe thunderstorm over India while examining the sensitivity of the simulation to three microphysical (MP) schemes (WDM6, Thompson and Morrison). The model simulated results (e.g., surface temperature, relative humidity, pressure, reflectivity and rainfall) for all sensitivity experiments are compared with observations (e.g., AWS, TRMM and DWR). There are major differences in the simulations of the thunderstorm among the MP schemes. The Morrison scheme simulates CAPE, surface properties, wind speed, vertical velocity, reflectivity and precipitation reasonably well, compared to other MP schemes, though there are some uncertainties. Therefore, an attempt is made to improve the simulation through modifications in the Morrison scheme. Different heterogeneous ice nucleation formulations have been tested into the Morrison double-moment bulk cloud MP scheme. We hypothesize that the improvement in cloud ice generation and its subsequent influence in cloud microphysics and dynamics through latent heat release may eventually lead to an improvement in thunderstorm simulation. The results demonstrate that the modification in the microphysical scheme better reproduces CAPE, wind speed, maximum reflectivity, vertical velocity and cloud hydrometeors (ice and mixed-phase processes) than the default Morrison and other schemes and compared to observations. The modified MP-scheme produces greater latent heating due to deposition in the upper troposphere and gives rise to increased updraft. This seems to be one of the most responsible processes that enhance the intensity of the storm compared to existing microphysical schemes. This study therefore provides a framework for the improvement of thunderstorm simulation through the modification of the cloud ice parameterization of the model.},

abstract = {Dual-Doppler radar data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Large Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (TRMM-LBA) field campaign are used to determine characteristic kinematic and reflectivity vertical structures associated with precipitation features observed during the wet season in the southwest region of Amazonia. Case studies of precipitating systems during TRMM-LBA as well as overarching satellite studies have shown large differences in convective intensity associated with changes that develop in low-level easterly flow [east regime (ER)] and westerly flow [west regime (WR)]. This study attempts to examine the vertical kinematic and heating structure of convection across the spectrum of precipitation features that occurred in each regime. Results show that convection in the ER is characterized by more intense updrafts and larger radar reflectivities above the melting level, in agreement with results from lightning detection networks. These regime differences are consistent with contrasts in composite thermal buoyancy between the regimes: above the boundary layer, the environment in the ER is characterized by a greater virtual temperature excess for near-surface rising parcels. Both regimes showed a peak in intensity during the late afternoon hours, as evidenced by radar reflectivity and kinematic characteristics, consistent with previous studies of rainfall and lightning in the Rond{\^{o}}nia (TRMM-LBA) region. After sunset, however, convective intensity in the WR decreases much more abruptly compared to the ER. In the stratiform–weak convective region, the ER showed both reflectivity and kinematic characteristics of classic stratiform structure after sunset through the early morning hours, consistent with the life cycle of mesoscale conjective systems (MCSs). Apparent heating (Q1) profiles were constructed for each regime assuming the vertical advection of dry static energy was the dominant forcing term. The resulting profiles show a peak centered near 8 km in the convective regions of both regimes, although the ER has a broader maximum compared to the WR. The breadth of the ER diabatic heating peak is consistent with the more dominant role of ice processes in ER convection.},

Errors in horizontal wind magnitude and direction are shown to be functions of wind direction and speed as well as spatial location. Vertical wind could be estimated with errors less than a few meters per second up to altitudes near 14 km over a region 4d × 4d, where 2d is the radar separation. Vertical wind variance at high altitudes is related to accumulation of errors due to the integration of the continuity equation. The cause of wind variance is assumed to be uncertainty in mean Doppler velocity estimates produced by spectrum broadening mechanisms (e.g., shear, turbulence). Two interpolation methods, used to estimate Doppler velocity at common grid locations, are compared and their contribution to Doppler velocity variance reduction is calculated.

abstract = {Quantitative nowcasts of rainfall are frequently based on the advection of rain fields observed by weather radar. Spectral Prognosis (S-PROG) is an advection-based nowcasting system that uses the observations that rain fields commonly exhibit both spatial and dynamic scaling properties, that is, the lifetime of a feature in the field is dependent on the scale of the feature (large features evolve more slowly than small features), and that features at all scales between the outer and inner observed scales are present in the field. The logarithm of the radar reflectivity field is disaggregated into a set or cascade of fields, in which each field in the set (or level in the cascade) represents the features of the original field over a limited range of scales. The Lagrangian temporal evolution of each level in the cascade is modeled using a simple autoregressive (lag 2) model, which automatically causes the forecast field to become smooth as the structures at the various scales evolve through their life cycles, or can be used to generate conditional simulations if the noise term is included. This paper describes the model and presents preliminary results.},

This paper investigates the effects the explicit versus implicit inclusion of aerosols in a microphysics parameterization scheme in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) – Advanced Research WRF (WRF-ARW) model has on cloud dynamics and microphysics. The testbed selected for this study is a severe mesoscale convective system with supercells that struck west and central parts of Serbia in the afternoon of July 21, 2014. Numerical products of two model runs, i.e. one with aerosols explicitly (WRF-AE) included and another with aerosols implicitly (WRF-AI) assumed, are compared against precipitation measurements from surface network of rain gauges, as well as against radar and satellite observations. The WRF-AE model accurately captured the transportation of dust from the north Africa over the Mediterranean and to the Balkan region. On smaller scales, both models displaced the locations of clouds situated above west and central Serbia towards southeast and under-predicted the maximum values of composite radar reflectivity. Similar to satellite images, WRF-AE shows the mesoscale convective system as a merged cluster of cumulonimbus clouds. Both models over-predicted the precipitation amounts; WRF-AE over-predictions are particularly pronounced in the zones of light rain, while WRF-AI gave larger outliers. Unlike WRF-AI, the WRF-AE approach enables the modelling of time evolution and influx of aerosols into the cloud which could be of practical importance in weather forecasting and weather modification. Several likely causes for discrepancies between models and observations are discussed and prospects for further research in this field are outlined.},

@article{Shapiro2009,
abstract = {The utility of the anelastic vertical vorticity equation in a weak-constraint (least squares error) variational dual-Doppler wind analysis procedure is explored. The analysis winds are obtained by minimizing a cost function accounting for the discrepancies between observed and analyzed radial winds, errors in the mass conservation equation, errors in the anelastic vertical vorticity equation, and spatial smoothness constraints. By using Taylor's frozen-turbulence hypothesis to shift analysis winds to observation points, discrepancies between radially projected analysis winds and radial wind observations can be calculated at the actual times and locations the data are acquired. The frozen-turbulence hypothesis is also used to evaluate the local derivative term in the vorticity equation. Tests of the analysis procedure are performed with analytical pseudo-observations of an array of translating and temporally decaying counterrotating updrafts and downdrafts generated from a Beltrami flow solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The experiments explore the value added to the analysis by the vorticity equation constraint in the common scenario of substantial missing low-level data (radial wind observations at heights beneath 1.5 km are withheld from the analysis). Experiments focus on the sensitivity of the most sensitive analysis variable-the vertical velocity component-to values of the weighting coefficients, volume scan period, number of volume scans, and errors in the estimated frozen-turbulence pattern-translation components. Although the vorticity equation constraint is found to add value to many of these analyses, the analysis can become significantly degraded if estimates of the pattern-translation components are largely in error or if the frozen-turbulence hypothesis itself breaks down. However, tests also suggest that these negative impacts can be mitigated if data are available in a rapid-scan mode.},

abstract = {Introduction The formation of hailstones is an intriguing aspect of precipitation development studies owing to the unique cloud systems in which hailstones form. As equal amounts are added of hailstones, for a given density the shells of equal mass will be of different thickness (Fig. 10.1). In particular, the formation of very large hailstones, some of which are greater than 51 mm in diameter, is of great interest. Models of hail growth can be very simple or imply very detailed processes (Takahashi 1976 and Fig. 10.2). Hailstones are typically defined as solid or nearly solid ice particles that are greater than 5 mm in diameter. The National Weather Service in the United States classifies hailstones as constituting severe hail if they are larger than 19 mm (3/4″) in diameter, and constituting very severe hail if the hailstones are larger than 51 mm (2″). These larger hailstones develop most frequently from rapid riming of higher-density graupel particles and/or large frozen drops. Studies suggest that high-plains storms produce most of their hail from graupel, and Southern Plains storms produce most from frozen drops (Fig. 10.3). It is not known exactly why this is so, but some have speculated that high-plains storms do not produce large water drops above the freezing level because they have cold cloud bases cooler than 5 °C (278.15 K) (Fig. 10.3) and the 500 mb temperature in the updraft core is perhaps 260.15 to 263.15 K. Thus, many of the hailstone embryos are perhaps formed from graupel.},

abstract = {Three methodologies for correcting the radar reflectivity factor (ZH) in the presence of partial beam blockage are implemented, compared, and evaluated using a polarimetric radar dataset from the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) in northwestern Mexico. One methodology uses simulated interactions between radar beams and digital terrain maps, while the other two invoke the self-consistency of polarimetric radar measurands in rainfall, and the relative insensitivity of a specific differential phase to beam blockage. While the different methodologies often agree to within 1–2 dB, significant disagreements can occur in regions of sharp azimuthal gradients in beam blockage patterns, and in areas where the terrain-caused radar clutter map is complex. These disagreements may be mitigated by the use of additional radar data to develop the polarimetric correction techniques, by a more sophisticated terrain-beam interaction model, or by a higher-resolution digital terrain map. Intercomparisons between ground radar data and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite overpasses suggest that all of the methodologies can correct mean ZH to within the expected uncertainty of such intercomparisons (1–1.5 dB). The polarimetric correction methods showed good results even in severely blocked regions (>10 dB reduction). The results suggest the possibility that all of the techniques may be valid approaches to correcting partial beam blockage, and within that context relative advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed. However, none of the techniques can correct radar data when weak echoes are reduced to noise by strong blocks, thus leading to biases in corrected ZH and rainfall climatologies.},

abstract = {The verification phase of the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP) Sydney 2000 Forecast Demon-stration Project (FDP) was intended to measure the skill of the participating nowcast algorithms in predicting the location of convection, rainfall rate and occurrence, wind speed and direction, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, and hail location and size. An additional question of interest was whether forecasters could improve the quality of the nowcasts compared to the FDP products alone. The nowcasts were verified using a variety of statistical techniques. Observational data came from radar reflectivity and rainfall analyses, a network of rain gauges, and human (spotter) observations. The verification results showed that the cell tracking algorithms predicted the location of the strongest cells with a mean error of about 15–30 km for a 1-h forecast, and were usually more accurate than an extrapolation (Lagrangian persistence) forecast. Mean location errors for the area tracking schemes were on the order of 20 km. Almost all of the algorithms successfully predicted the frequency of rain throughout the forecast period, although most underestimated the frequency of high rain rates. The skill in predicting rain occurrence decreased very quickly into the forecast period. In particular, the algorithms could not predict the precise location of heavy rain beyond the first 10–20 min. Using radar analyses as verification, the algorithms' spatial forecasts were consistently more skillful than simple persistence. However, when verified against rain gauge observations at point locations, the algorithms had difficulty beating persistence, mainly due to differences in spatial and temporal resolution. Only one algorithm attempted to forecast gust fronts. The results for a limited sample showed a mean absolute error of 7 km h Ϫ1 and mean bias of 3 km h Ϫ1 in the speed of the gust fronts during the FDP. The errors in sea-breeze front forecasts were half as large, with essentially no bias. Verification of the hail associated with the 3 November tornadic storm showed that the two algorithms that estimated hail size and occurrence successfully diagnosed the onset and cessation of the hail to within 30 min of the reported sightings. The time evolution of hail size was reasonably well captured by the algorithms, and the predicted mean and maximum hail diameters were consistent with the observations. The Thunderstorm Interactive Forecast System (TIFS) allowed forecasters to modify the output of the cell tracking nowcasts, primarily using it to remove cells that were insignificant or diagnosed with incorrect motion. This manual filtering resulted in markedly reduced mean cell position errors when compared to the unfiltered forecasts. However, when forecasters attempted to adjust the storm tracks for a small number of well-defined intense cells, the position errors increased slightly, suggesting that in such cases the objective guidance is probably the best estimate of storm motion.},

abstract = {AbstractA method for the parameterization of ice-phase microphysics is proposed and used to develop a new bulk microphysics scheme. All ice-phase particles are represented by several physical properties that evolve freely in time and space. The scheme prognoses four ice mixing ratio variables, total mass, rime mass, rime volume, and number, allowing 4 degrees of freedom for representing the particle properties using a single category. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach.The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that illustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

Through the use of KPOL DP and disdrometer measurements from Kwajalein, quality control (QC) and reflectivity calibration techniques were developed and adapted for use. Data studies in light rain show that KPOL DP measurements are of sufficient quality for these applications. While the methodology for the development of such applications is well documented, the tuning of specific algorithms to the particular regime and observed raindrop size distributions requires a comprehensive testing and adjustment period. Presented are algorithm descriptions and results from five case studies in which QC and absolute reflectivity calibration were performed and assessed. Also described is a unique approach for calibrating the differential reflectivity field when vertically pointing observations are not available. Results show the following: 1) DP-basedQCprovides superior results compared to the legacy Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) QC algorithm (based on height and reflectivity thresholds), and 2) absolute reflectivity calibration can be performed using observations of light rain via a published differential phase-based integration technique; results are within 61 dB compared to independent measurements. Future extension of these algorithms to upgraded Weather Surveillance Radar-1988Doppler (WSR-88D) polarization diverse radars will benefit NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Precipitation Measurement Missions (PMM) validation programs. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Electrification and lightning are simulated for a small continental multicell storm. The results are consistent with observations and thus provide additional understanding of the charging processes and evolution of this storm. The first six observed lightning flashes were all negative cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes, after which intracloud (IC) flashes also occurred between middle and upper levels of the storm. The model simulation reproduces the basic evolution of lightning from low and middle levels to upper levels. The observed lightning indicated an initial charge structure of at least an inverted dipole (negative charge above positive). The simulations show that noninductive charge separation higher in the storm can enhance the main negative charge sufficiently to produce negative CG flashes before upper-level IC flashes commence. The result is a ''bottom-heavy'' tripole charge structure with midlevel negative charge and a lower positive charge region that is more significant than the upper positive region, in contrast to the traditional tripole structure that has a less significant lower positive charge region. Additionally, the occurrence of cloud-to-ground lightning is not necessarily a result of excess net charge carried by the storm, but it is primarily caused by the local potential imbalance between the lowest charge regions. The two-moment microphysics scheme used for this study predicted mass mixing ratio and number con-centration of cloud droplets, rain, ice crystals, snow, and graupel. Bulk particle density of graupel was also predicted, which allows a single category to represent a greater range of particle characteristics. (An addi-tional hail category is available but was not needed for the present study.) The prediction of hydrometeor number concentration is particularly critical for charge separation at higher temperatures (258 , T , 2208C) in the mixed phase region, where ice crystals are produced by rime fracturing (Hallett–Mossop process) and by splintering of freezing drops. Cloud droplet concentration prediction also affected the rates of inductive charge separation between graupel and droplets.},

abstract = {This study investigates the use of polarimetric variables for estimating hail size. Archived data from the KOUN polarimetric radar in Norman, Oklahoma are obtained for three hail-producing events A total of 45 hail reports are used for analysis, including hail sizes ranging from 0.75" to 4.25". Horizontal and vertical structures of reflectivity (Z H), differential reflectivity (Z DR), and correlation coefficient ($\rho$ HV) associated with these reports are examined using Interactive Data Language (IDL) programs. Comparison of these images allow for the hail to be categorized into two groups based on Z DR and $\rho$ HV signatures: category 1: hail less than 1.75" in diameter and hail 1.75" or higher in diameter. RHI images reveal differences in the vertical structures of these categories; extended columns of low Z DR and $\rho$ HV are observed for the larger hail. Also, vertical profiles, produced for each report, show a more substantial decrease in $\rho$ HV below the melting layer for hail 1.75" or larger. Box-and-whisker plots and discriminant analysis are then used to determine the ability of Z DR and $\rho$ HV to distinguish between the two categories. Although Z DR appeared promising for estimating hail size, the discriminant analysis revealed that $\rho$ HV is the best variable to discriminate between the categories. 3},

abstract = {The sensitivity of polarimetric variables at a 5-cm wavelength to raindrop size and axial ratio is examined using T-matrix modeling of the scattering process for gamma raindrop size distributions fitted to tropical rainfall collected at Darwin, Australia. These simulations demonstrate that, while specific differential phase (KDP)?based estimates of rainfall, attenuation (AH), and differential attenuation are less affected by drop size distribution (DSD) variations, large drop occurrence can have significant impacts. Attenuation is sensitive to the occurrence of large drops, which can produce anomalously high values associated with resonance effect scattering. The polarimetric variables are sensitive to the relation between the equivolume diameter and axial ratio. Variations in the assumed form of the raindrop axial ratio can result in significant biases in rainfall and attenuation. Combined rainfall estimators, which include differential reflectivity (ZDR), such as R(KDP,ZDR) and R(AH,ZDR) are more robust to both DSD and raindrop axial ratio variations. The results also demonstrate that polarimetric techniques employed to classify the phase of hydrometeors are sensitive to the assumed raindrop axial ratio.},

abstract = {The microphysical characteristics of deep convective storms are a critically important, yet difficult aspect of storm morphology to observe in situ. These observations play a large role in several areas of ongoing research, but detailed observations in key portions of clouds do not exist with the currently available measurement platforms. To facilitate these observations, a balloon-borne particle imaging device known as the PArticle Size, Image, and Velocity (PASIV) probe was developed at the National Severe Storms Laboratory, which is capable of measuring particle counts on scales as small as 50 m. The videosonde observations from the PASIV showed that precipitation particle counts change rapidly between analysis layers, sometimes by as much as a few orders of magnitude (10 2 -10 4 in adjacent layers), and radar reflectivities calculated directly from observed particle size distributions agree with mobile radar measurements. Furthermore, the observations allow the distributions to be partitioned into various particle types, which sheds light on which particles are dominating the radar signal at various times. These distributions per particle type, and their associated mixing ratios, agree with independent model analysis. Additionally, single-, double-, and triple-moment parameterized particle size distribution functions are fit to various layers, with the general result that ice particles are easily represented by exponential distributions while rain is better fit with a gamma distribution. The parametric fits for ice and rain distributions found here support previous work and some portions of modeled microphysics, but also suggest room for improvement when deciding which schemes to use with cloud modeling.

However, a more intensive characterization of how lightning relates to traditional radar-based metrics of storm intensity may provide further operational utility. This study addresses the supercell storm mode because of the intrinsic relationship between a supercell's characteristic rotating updraft-downdraft couplet, or mesocyclone, and its prolific ability to produce severe weather. Lightning and radar measurements of a diverse sample of 19 supercell thunderstorms were used to assess the conceptual model that lightning and the mesocyclone may be linked by the updraft's role in the formation and enhancement of each. Analysis of early stages of supercell development showed that the initial lightning jump occurred prior to the time of mesocyclogenesis inferred from three methods by median values of 5 to 10 minutes.

We present here a combined approach to perform a detailed cloud vertical structure analysis, by means of MODIS VIS-NIR products and C-band polarimetric radar data. Satellite products include estimates of cloud optical thickness, cloud particles effective radius and cloud top phase, to be matched with the polarimetric hydrometeor 3D classification as obtained by a fuzzy logic algorithm. The problem of matching of the two datasets is discussed and the procedure is applied to three case studies that occurred in Northern Italy. Results are presented in terms of vertical hydrometeor profile and satellite derived microphysical cloud properties, showing the capability of the combined approach in the 3D rendering of cloud structures, with envisaged applications for precipitation studies and data assimilation in meteorological models.},

abstract = {On the evening of 28 July 1997 the city of Fort Collins, Colorado, experienced a devastating flash flood that caused five fatalities and over 200 million dollars in damage. Maximum accumulations of rainfall in the western part of the city exceeded 10 in. in a 6-h period. This study presents a multiscale meteorological overview of the event utilizing a wide variety of instrument platforms and data including rain gauge, CSU-CHILL multiparameter radar, Next Generation Radar, National Lightning Detection Network, surface and Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System observations, satellite observations, and synoptic analyses. Many of the meteorological features associated with the Fort Collins flash flood typify those of similar events in the western United States. Prominent features in the Fort Collins case included the presence of a 500-hPa ridge axis over northeastern Colorado; a weak shortwave trough on the western side of the ridge; postfrontal easterly upslope flow at low levels; weak to moderate southwesterly flow aloft; a deep, moist warm layer in the sounding; and the occurrence of a quasi-stationary rainfall system. In contrast to previous events such as the Rapid City or Big Thompson floods, the thermodynamic environment of the Fort Collins storm exhibited only modest instability, consistent with low lightning flash rates and an absence of hail and other severe storm signatures. Radar, rain gauge, and lightning observations provided a detailed view of the cloud and precipitation morphology. Polarimetric radar observations suggest that a coupling between warm-rain collision coalescence processes and ice processes played an important role in the rainfall production. Dual-Doppler radar and mesoscale wind analyses revealed that the low-level flow field associated with a bow echo located 60 km to the southeast of Fort Collins may have been responsible for a brief easterly acceleration in the low-level winds during the last 1.5 h of the event. The enhanced flow interacted with both topography and the convection located over Fort Collins, resulting in a quasi-stationary convective system and the heaviest rainfall of the evening.},

These systems, from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, had the capability to nowcast the location and, with one exception, the intensity of convective storms. Six of the most significant convective storm cases from the 3-month FDP were selected for evaluating the performance of these state-of-the-art nowcasting systems, which extrapolated storms using a variety of methods, including cell and area tracking, model winds, and sounding winds. Three of the systems had the ability to forecast the initiation and growth of storms. Nowcasts for 30 and 60 min were evaluated, and it was found that even for such short time periods the skill of the extrapolation-only systems was often very low. Extrapolation techniques that allowed for differential motion performed slightly better, since high-impact storms often have motions different than surrounding storms. The ability to forecast initiation, growth, and dissipation is in its infancy. However, it was demonstrated that significant improvement in forecast accuracy was obtained for several of these cases when the locations of boundary layer convergence lines (sea breeze and gust fronts) were used in the nowcasts. Based on the experiences during the FDP, and in forecast offices in the United States, a discussion is provided of the overall status of nowcasting convective storms. In addition, proposed future directions are discussed concerning the specificity of nowcast products, experimental test beds, and additional observations and research required.},

abstract = {Many studies over the past several decades have attempted to correlate trends in lightning (e.g., rates, polarity) to severe weather occurrence. These studies mainly used cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning infor- mation due to the ease of data availability, high detection efficiency, and broad coverage across the United States, with somewhat inconclusive results. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that trends in total lightning are more robustly correlated to severe weather occurrence, with rapid increases in total lightning observed 10s of minutes prior to the onset of severe weather. Unfortunately, total lightning observations are not as nu- merous, or available over the same areal coverage domain, as provided by CG networks. Relatively few studies have examined concurrent trends in both total andCGlightning within the same severe thunderstorm, or even large sets of thunderstorms using an objective lightning jump algorithm. Multiple studies have shown that the total flash rate rapidly increases prior to the onset of severe weather. What is untested within the same framework is the use of CG information to perform the same task. Herein, total and CG lightning trends for 711 thunderstorms occurring in four regions of the country were examined to demonstrate the increased utility that total lightning provides overCGlightning, specifically within the framework of developing a useful lightning-based severe weather warning decision support tool. Results indicate that while both lightning datasets demonstrate the presence of increased lightning activity prior to the onset of severe weather, the use of total lightning trends was more effective thanCGtrends [probability of detection (POD),79%versus 66%; false alarm rate (FAR), 36% versus 53%; critical success index (CSI), 55% versus 38%; Heidke skill score (HSS), 0.71 versus 0.55]. Moreover, 40% of false alarms associated with total lightning, and 16% of false alarms withCGlightning trends, occurred when a lightning jump associated with a severe weather ‘‘warning'' was already in effect. If these false alarms are removed, the FAR drops from 36% to 22% for total lightning and from 53% to 44% for CG lightning. Importantly, average lead times prior to severe weather occurrence were higher using total lightning as compared withCGlightning (20.65 versus 13.54 min). The ultimate goal of this study was to demonstrate the increased utility of total lightning information that the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) will provide to operational meteorology in anticipation of severe convective weather on a hemispheric scale once Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) is deployed in the next decade.},

These events are characterized by large damaging hail in excess of 2 cm, convective wind gusts greater than 90 km h-1 and tornadoes, and contribute a quarter of all natural hazard-related losses in the country. This impact has lead to a growing body of research and insight into these events. In this article, the state of knowledge regarding their incidence, distribution, and the resulting hail, tornado, convective wind, and lightning risk will be reviewed. Applying this assessment of knowledge, the implications for forecasting, the warning process, and how these events may respond to climate change and variability will also be discussed. Based on this review, ongoing work in the field is outlined, and several potential avenues for future research and exploration are suggested. Most notably, the need for improved observational or proxy climatologies, the forecasting guidelines for tornadoes, and the need for a greater understanding of how severe thunderstorms respond to climate variability are highlighted.},

abstract = {Decadal average lightning fatality rates in the United Kingdom have decreased markedly from 1.09 deaths per million population per year (M−1 yr−1) in the 1850s to 0.02 M−1 yr−1 by the 2010s. Factors contributing to the decrease are explored. They include a large reduction in the national workforce engaged in manually-intensive agriculture. Consequently, agricultural workforce deaths fell from 38% of all lightning deaths around 1850–9% by 2000. The percentage of the national population living in urban areas, where many jobs were indoors, increased. As buildings were modernised with electric and plumbing circuits they offered greater protection from lightning. Consequently, deaths indoors fell from 39% in 1850 to 11% in 1950, and with none in the past 50 years. Other factors contributing to lower fatality rates in recent decades included improved thunderstorm forecasts, lightning location detection systems, stricter safety regulations for outdoor workers, advances in the medical treatment of lightning casualties, better communication and road networks to request and receive medical help promptly, and greater public awareness of the lightning threat. Factors slowing down the fatality rate decrease include population growth and, in recent decades, the increased participation in outdoor leisure and sports pursuits in exposed locations. Fatality rates in other countries are explored. It is suggested that by recognising the influence each factor has on lightning fatality rates, countries currently experiencing high lightning fatality rates may be able to accelerate and enhance the beneficial impacts of some factors, albeit after adjustments to reflect their national social, economic and cultural characteristics.},

abstract = {Three-hourly present weather reports from ;15 000 stations around the globe and from the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set from 1975 to 1997 were analyzed for diurnal variations in the frequency of occurrence for various types of precipitation (drizzle, nondrizzle, showery, nonshowery, and snow) and thunderstorms. Significant diurnal variations with amplitudes exceeding 20% of the daily mean are found over much of the globe, especially over land areas and during summer. Drizzle and nonshowery precipitation occur most frequently in the morning around 0600 local solar time (LST) over most land areas and from midnight to 0400 LST over many oceanic areas. Showery precipitation and thunderstorms occur much more frequently in the late afternoon than other times over most land areas in all seasons, with a diurnal amplitude exceeding 50% of the daily mean frequencies. Over the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, and many other oceanic areas adjacent to continents, showery precipitation is most frequent in the morning around 0600 LST, which is out of phase with land areas. Over the tropical and southern oceans, showery precipitation tends to peak from midnight to 0400 LST. Maritime thunderstorms occur most frequently around midnight. It is suggested that the diurnal variations in atmospheric relative humidity contribute to the morning maximum in the frequency of occurrence for drizzle and nonshowery precipitation, especially over land areas. Solar heating on the ground produces a late-afternoon maximum of convective available potential energy in the atmosphere that favors late-afternoon moist convection and showery precipitation over land areas during summer. This strong continental diurnal cycle induces a diurnal cycle of opposite phase in low-level convergence over large nearby oceanic areas that favors a morning maximum of maritime showery precipitation. Larger low-level convergence induced by pressure tides and higher relative humidity at night than at other times may contribute to the nighttime maximum of maritime showery and nonshowery precipitation over remote oceans far away from continents.},

Thus, it is expected that different meteorological systems act in different regions of the country affecting the cloud-to-ground (CG) lighting activity throughout the year. Based on 13 years of LIS measurements (1998-2010) at a 0.1{\textordmasculine} resolution, it was assessed the monthly variation of the lightning activity over the five macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South). This CG flash rate densities (FRD) are then associated to the frequency of occurrence of meteorological systems and to the monthly variations of precipitation in order to verify possible correlations between lightning and rainfall and their association to meteorological systems. The concept of rain yield per flash was used to assess the convection regimes. It was found that precipitation and lightning activity at these regions were well correlated to the known meteorological systems of each region. Moreover, the rain yield per flash monthly variation and overall mean were able to capture the physical nature of these systems, such as deeper convection (like MCS) or more stratiform precipitation (like the SACZ).},

abstract = {Hail climatology is usually weakly known and unsatisfactorily standardised in measurement techniques. Trentino, in the Italian Alps, boasts a 271-hailpad network operated since 1974, covering nearly the whole of the regional agricultural area. Many hail indices, concerning both extensive and energetic features of hailstorms, were investigated in a 35-year period, seeking for climatic trends. The results show that, despite a slight, non-significant trend of decrease in the number of events and in the hit surfaces, most energetic indices, which are directly correlated to the damage to crops, have increased in the period, some at considerable rates. Particularly, indices referring to extreme values show the clearest trends. The correlation with atmospheric variables from ECMWF's reanalysis (ERA-40) was considered. Data were processed at six gridpoints, to calculate three instability-related indices. Other ten variables were considered, either integrated over the atmospheric column or at separate atmospheric levels. Correlations between seasonally averaged single atmospheric predictors and hail indices show a varied record of cases, where only some pairs of atmospheric predictors and hail indices give positive results. Statistical links were also sought using a multivariate method involving principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square regression (PSLR) techniques. Despite the more general approach allowed by these methods, only some hail indices respond to the attempt of setting up satisfactory statistical models. The principal-component predictors are built with many atmospheric variables, warning against a simplified use of correlations of some hail indices with few atmospheric predictors. Particularly, it is shown that the number of events is not a useful index for assessing general climatic features of hailstorms, and that the use of one instability index alone – like convective available potential energy (CAPE) – does not allow a thorough description of the links between atmospheric precursors of hail and its real occurrence},

abstract = {To improve the accuracy of radar rainfall estimates, this study examines rainfall relationships derived from polarimetric variables calculated from Drop Size Distributions (DSDs) measured by POSS (Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System) and PARSIVEL (PARticle Size and VELocity) disdrometers for eight different rainfall events in Korea associated with the Changma front, low pressure systems, typhoons, or the indirect effects of typhoons. Analysis of the correlation coefficients between polarimetric variables as independent parameters shows that multicollinearity is expected for Z–KDP, Z–AH, and KDP–AH. Of these, R(Z, KDP) is the only relationship that had too low an accuracy for application to radar rainfall estimation. R(Z, ZDR, KDP) and R(Z, KDP, AH) were also omitted from this analysis because their intercept coefficients were too large. Analysis of the sensitivity of radar rainfall estimation to DSDs variation shows that the latest observed DSDs perform well, as much as 2.4 mm h−1 for RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and 0.23 for NE (Normalized Error) in maximum. The statistical scores of each radar rainfall estimator vary between different rainfall events. This paper examines a new approach to radar rainfall estimation that is similar to the ensemble technique widely used in numerical prediction models. The ensemble members were chosen based on the average and standard deviation of their RMSE and NE for eight rainfall events. Two different weighting schemes were applied to each ensemble and the members were weighted equally or, alternatively, weighted based on their statistical scores. The performance of eight ensemble sets was examined using four independent rainfall events. There is little difference in the accuracy of each ensemble with respect to the weighting scheme applied. An ensemble composed of R(Z,ZDR), R(Z), and R(KDP), all given an equal weighting, was the most accurate.},

Due to the local-scale extent of hail-affected areas and a lack of appropriate observing systems in most regions, hailstorms are not captured accurately and comprehensively, which makes statistical analysis of their frequency or climatology more difficult. Various studies have been conducted so far to describe and analyze the frequency of hailstorms or related impacts. These studies, however, refer to a wide range of spatial scales and consider different time periods, investigation methods, or hailstone diameters.This article will give a comprehensive overview and review of the present state of knowledge on hail hazard and hail frequency over recent decades up to centuries across Europe and is intended as a reference for future studies. We attempted to summarize and synthesize the various prevailing studies with the objective to identify regions that are most prone to hail hazard. Another focus is put on mechanisms that may explain spatial variability and inhomogeneities in hail frequency observed across various spatial scales.},

abstract = {The response of lightning rates over Europe to arrival of high speed solar wind streams at Earth is investigated using a superposed epoch analysis. Fast solar wind stream arrival is determined from modulation of the solar wind Vy component, measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. Lightning rate changes around these event times are determined from the very low frequency arrival time difference (ATD) system of the UK Met Office. Arrival of high speed streams at Earth is found to be preceded by a decrease in total solar irradiance and an increase in sunspot number and Mg II emissions. These are consistent with the high speed stream's source being co-located with an active region appearing on the Eastern solar limb and rotating at the 27 d period of the Sun. Arrival of the high speed stream at Earth also coincides with a small (∼1%) but rapid decrease in galactic cosmic ray flux, a moderate (∼6%) increase in lower energy solar energetic protons (SEPs), and a substantial, statistically significant increase in lightning rates. These changes persist for around 40 d in all three quantities. The lightning rate increase is corroborated by an increase in the total number of thunder days observed by UK Met stations, again persisting for around 40 d after the arrival of a high speed solar wind stream. This result appears to contradict earlier studies that found an anti-correlation between sunspot number and thunder days over solar cycle timescales. The increase in lightning rates and thunder days that we observe coincides with an increased flux of SEPs which, while not being detected at ground level, nevertheless penetrate the atmosphere to tropospheric altitudes. This effect could be further amplified by an increase in mean lightning stroke intensity that brings more strokes above the detection threshold of the ATD system. In order to remove any potential seasonal bias the analysis was repeated for daily solar wind triggers occurring during the summer months (June to August). Though this reduced the number of solar wind triggers to 32, the response in both lightning and thunder day data remained statistically significant. This modulation of lightning by regular and predictable solar wind events may be beneficial to medium range forecasting of hazardous weather.},

abstract = {Western Europe is typically prone to extreme weather events during the winter months, which typically take the form of windstorms or flooding. The storm Desmond brought strong winds and heavy rain to Ireland, northern England and Scotland in December 2015, resulting in an estimated $500 million worth of damage and extensive flooding, particularly in the region of Cumbria. Accurate modelling of such extreme weather events is necessary to ensure that the societal and infrastructural risk associated with these phenomena is minimised. In statistical modelling, extreme value analysis is typically used to model the rate and size of extreme weather events. Typically, practitioners can use the outputs of such an analysis to design flood defences to a standard such that there is only a small probability that defences are breached in a given year. These models can be applied at individual sites or adapted to address questions related to the spatial extent of an event, which is important for policy makers eager to reduce the economic and societal impacts associated with extreme weather. One aim of this thesis is to improve inference with regarding to existing extreme value methodology. First, we propose a reparameterisation of the likelihood corresponding to the Poisson process model for excesses above a high threshold, which improves mixing in a Bayesian framework and ensures more rapid convergence of the parameter chains in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine. The Poisson process model is often preferred for modelling extremes of non-stationary processes as the parameters are invariant to the choice of threshold; our approach may increase the possibility of this model being used more widely. Second, we propose an adjustment to the likelihood when implementing a spatial hierarchical model for extremes, which accounts for the dependence in the data when estimating model uncertainty. In both cases, the improvement in inference should increase confidence among practitioners of the outputs obtained from extreme value models. The main influence of extreme weather events in winter is from the passage of low-pressure extratropical cyclones from the North Atlantic. The second aim of this thesis is to quantify the risk associated with extreme wind speed events, which we call windstorms, arising from an extratropical cyclone system. First, we develop a model capturing the spatial variation of the track associated with the cyclone, from which we can simulate synthetic tracks with the same statistical characteristics of the observed record. Second, we describe an approach for modelling the spatial extent and severity of windstorms relative to the storm track, from which we can provide improved estimates of risk associated with windstorms at individual sites and jointly over a spatial domain. The methods described in this thesis can be used to address multiple questions related to windstorm risk, that is not available using current methodology.},

abstract = {Abstract It was once generally thought that stratiform precipitation was something occurring primarily, if not exclusively, in middle latitudes—in baroclinic cyclones and fronts. Early radar observations in the Tropics, however, showed large radar echoes composed of convective rain alongside stratiform precipitation, with the stratiform echoes covering great areas and accounting for a large portion of the tropical rainfall. These observations seemed paradoxical, since stratiform precipitation should not have been occurring in the Tropics, where baroclinic cyclones do not occur. Instead it was falling from convection-generated clouds, generally thought to be too violent to be compatible with the layered, gently settling behavior of stratiform precipitation. In meteorology, convection is a dynamic concept; specifically, it is the rapid, efficient, vigorous overturning of the atmosphere required to neutralize an unstable vertical distribution of moist static energy. Most clouds in the Tropics are convection-...},

abstract = {Lightning discharges are simulated by using a stochastic dielectric breakdown model within a numerical thunderstorm model with extensive parameterizations of electrification mechanisms. The lightning model simulates the macroscopic bidirectional extension of discharges as a step-by-step stochastic process. Discharge channels are propagated on a uniform grid, and the direction of propagation (including diagonals) for a particular step is chosen randomly, with the probability for choosing a particular direction depending on the net electric field. After each propagation step the electric fields are recomputed via Poissons equation to account for the effect of the conducting channel. The lightning parameterization produces realistic looking, three-dimensional, branched lightning discharges. A variety of lightning types have been produced, including intracloud discharges, negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, and positive CG lightning. The model simulations support the hypothesis that negative CG flashes occur only when a region of positive charge exists below the main negative charge region. Similarly, simulated positive CG flashes were found to occur only in regions of storms where the two significant charge layers closest to ground had roughly a normal dipole structure (i.e., positive charge above negative).

A three-step procedure is proposed. First, the motion field of precipitation is determined by variational radar echo tracking. Second, radar reflectivity is advected by means of a modified semi-Lagrangian advection scheme assuming stationary motion. Third, the Eulerian and Lagrangian persistence forecasts are compared to observations to calculate the lifetime and other measures of predictability. The procedure is repeated with images that have been decomposed according to scales to describe the scale-dependence of predictability. The analysis has a threefold application: (i) determine the scale-dependence of predictability, (ii) set a standard against which the skill for quantitative precipitation forecasting by numerical modeling can be evaluated, and (iii) extend nowcasting by optimal extrapolation of radar precipitation patterns. The methodology can be applied to other field variables such as brightness temperatures of weather satellites imagery.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional dynamic cloud model is used to investigate electrification of the full life cycle of an idealized continental multicell storm. Five laboratory-based parameterizations of noninductive graupel-ice charge separation are compared. Inductive (i.e., electric field-dependent) charge separation is tested for rebounding graupel-droplet collisions. Each noninductive graupel-ice parameterization is combined with variations in the effectiveness of inductive charging (off, moderate, and strong) and in the minimum ice crystal concentration (10 or 50 L−1). Small atmospheric ion processes such as hydrometeor attachment and point discharge at the ground are treated explicitly. Three of the noninductive schemes readily produced a normal polarity charge structure, consisting of a main negative charge region with an upper main positive charge region and a lower positive charge region. Negative polarity cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes occurred when the lower positive charge (LPC) region had sufficient charge density to cause high electric fields. Two of the three also produced one or more +CG flashes. The other two noninductive charging schemes, which are dependent on the graupel rime accretion rate, tended to produce an initially inverted polarity charge structure and +CG flashes. The model results suggest that inductive graupel-droplet charge separation could play a role in the development of lower charge regions. Noninductive charging, on the other hand, was also found to be capable of producing strong lower charge regions in the tests with a minimum ice crystal concentration of 50 L−1.},

The error in estimating the mean frequency $\nu$̄ is found to increase as n−1/2, where n is the number of sites placed within a region. If within a region there are proportionally more large hailstorms or if most of the area covered by hail is commonly due to a few large hailstorms, then fewer sites will be needed to estimate the mean point hail frequency.

abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R convective initiation (CI) algorithm predicts CI in real time over the next 0–60 min. While GOES-R CI has been very successful in tracking nascent clouds and obtaining cloud-top growth and height characteristics relevant to CI in an object-tracking framework, its performance has been hindered by elevated false-alarm rates, and it has not optimally combined satellite observations with other valuable data sources. Presented here are two statistical learning approaches that incorporate numerical weather prediction (NWP) input within the established GOES-R CI framework to produce probabilistic forecasts: logistic regression (LR) and an artificial-intelligence approach known as random forest (RF). Both of these techniques are used to build models that are based on an extensive database of CI events and nonevents and are evaluated via cross validation and on independent case studies. With the proper choice of probability thresholds, both the LR and RF techniques incorporating NWP data produce substantially fewer false alarms than when only GOES data are used. The NWP information identifies environmental conditions (as favorable or unfavorable) for the development of convective storms and improves the skill of the CI nowcasts that operate on GOES-based cloud objects, as compared with when the satellite IR fields are used alone. The LR procedure performs slightly better overall when 14 skill measures are used to quantify the results and notably better on independent case study days.},

abstract = {The Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment (MCTEX) was conducted over the Tiwi Islands 50-100 km north of Darwin, Australia, during November-December 1995. Two MCTEX cases are presented in this study. First, the convective evolution is summarised, including the processes by which shallow precipitating cumulus clouds evolved into electrically active, deep convection. Using multiparameter radar (C-band; 5.3 cm) estimates, the history of precipitation-sized ice and liquid water is compared to lightning-flash rates. In this context, the non-inductive graupel-ice particle charging theory is evaluated. For both case study days, the first deep convection was anchored to the leeward coast sea-breeze front. First, shallow precipitating cells originating from the island interior created evaporatively cooled pools that focused surface convergence along their perimeter. Rapid convective development ensued as these cool pools approached the sea-breeze front, triggering higher order cloud mergers along the sea-breeze front. This vigorous deep convection produced an extensive cold pool with convection persisting along its western edge where the environmental wind shear enabled more vertically oriented updraughts. The temporal evolution of mixed-phase graupel mass was compared to lightning-flash rates. Lightning was detected only after convective cells produced significant quantities of millimeter-sized ice particles. Lightning was not detected in predominately warm-rain cells. Furthermore, fluctuations in graupel mass were correlated with fluctuations in lightning-flash rates. Cloud-to-ground lightning was found to be closely tied to the mixed-phase graupel mass, consistent with the non-inductive graupel-ice particle charging theory. Polarimetric radar estimates also suggested that graupel formed as raindrops were lofted above the freezing level by convective updraughts.},

These include strong (> 40 dBZ) radar echoes extending\nto great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low brightness\ntemperatures at 37 and 85 GHz.

abstract = {Abstract This study evaluates the sensitivity of winter precipitation to numerous aspects of a bulk, mixed-phase microphysical parameterization found in three widely used mesoscale models [the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University?National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5), the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC), and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model]. Sensitivities of the microphysics to primary ice initiation, autoconversion, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, treatment of graupel, and parameters controlling the snow and rain size distributions are tested. The sensitivity tests are performed by simulating various cloud depths (with different cloud-top temperatures) using flow over an idealized two-dimensional mountain. The height and width of the two-dimensional barrier are designed to reproduce an updraft pattern with extent and magnitude consistent with documented freezing-drizzle cases. By increasing the moisture profile to saturation at low temperatures, a deep, precipitating snow cloud is also simulated. Upon testing the primary sensitivities of the microphysics scheme in two dimensions as reported in the present study, the MM5 with the modified scheme will be tested in multiple case studies and the results will be compared to observations in a forthcoming companion paper, Part II. The key results of this study are 1) the choice of ice initiation schemes is relatively unimportant for deep precipitating snow clouds but more important for shallow warm clouds having cloud-top temperature greater than ?13°C, 2) the assumed snow size distribution and associated snow diffusional growth along with the assumed graupel size distribution and method of transforming rimed snow into graupel have major impacts on the mass of cloud water and formation of freezing drizzle, and 3) a proper simulation of drizzle using a single-moment scheme and exponential size distribution requires an increase in the rain intercept parameter, thereby reducing rain terminal velocities to values more characteristic of drizzle.},

Besides the addition and modification of several hail processes from a bulk three-class hail scheme, further modifications were made to the three-ice processes, including allowing greater ice supersaturation and mitigating spurious evaporation/sublimation in the saturation adjustment scheme, allowing graupel/hail to transition to snow via vapor growth and hail to transition to graupel via riming, wet graupel to become hail, and the inclusion of a rain evaporation correction and vapor diffusivity factor. The improved three-ice snow/graupel size-mapping schemes were adjusted to be more stable at higher mixing ratios an...},

abstract = {During the past years a VLF/LF lightning detection network (LINET) was developed at the University of Munich, which provides continuous data for both research and operational purposes. In particular, the network introduces five new features: a) total lightning capability: both cloud-to-ground strokes (CG) and cloud lightning (IC) are measured; b) low-amplitude reporting: weak lightning events from discharge channel with currents well below 5 kA are detected within the central part of the network, whereby IC events dominate; c) new 3D- discrimination: a time-of-arrival method is utilized to separate CG from IC with good reliability, provided that the sensor baseline does not exceed $\sim$250 km; d) IC emission height: for each cloud event a height is determined which is thought to reflect the central region of the involved channel; and e) optimised location accuracy: due to precision and combined action of all influential network components, complemented by site-error corrections, the position accuracy of strokes reaches an average value as small as $\sim$150 m, whereby false locations (‘outliers') rarely occur. During international co-operations LINET has been deployed in four continents: Europe (initially Germany), South America (area of Bauru, Brazil), Australia (around Darwin), and Central Africa (Benin). Since the features quoted above could be verified in the tests, a 65-sensor network was established in Europe and started on May 1, 2006, in co- operation with the service company nowcast. LINET covers a wide area approximately from longitude −10° to 25° to latitude 35° to 66°; it is available for scientific projects and officially utilized by the GermanWeather Service for operational purposes. Meanwhile, the networkwas extended by deployment of additional sites so that it comprises about 90 sensors in 17 countries.},

abstract = {Abstract Although much work has been done at S band to automatically identify hydrometeors by using polarimetric radar, several challenges are presented when adapting such algorithms to X band. At X band, attenuation and non-Rayleigh scattering can pose significant problems. This study seeks to develop a hydrometeor identification (HID) algorithm for X band based on theoretical simulations using the T-matrix scattering model of seven different hydrometeor types: rain, drizzle, aggregates, pristine ice crystals, low-density graupel, high-density graupel, and vertical ice. Hail and mixed-phase hydrometeors are excluded for the purposes of this study. Non-Rayleigh scattering effects are explored by comparison with S-band simulations. Variable ranges based on the theoretical simulations are used to create one-dimensional fuzzy-logic membership beta functions that form the basis of the new X-band HID. The theory-based X-band HID is applied to a case from the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CA...},

To do this, three aspects of previous parameterizations have been modified: 1) To account for subgrid-scale variations, the initiation point is chosen randomly from among grid points at which the electric field magnitude is above a threshold value, instead of being assigned always to the grid point having the maximum electric field magnitude. 2) The threshold value for initiation can either be constant, as in previous parameterizations, or can vary with height to allow different flash initiation hypotheses to be tested. 3) Instead of stopping at larger ambient electric field magnitudes, extensive flash development can continue in regions having a weak ambient electric field but a substantial charge density. This behavior is based on lightning observations and conceptual models of lightning physics. However, like previous parameteriza...},

In addition to the large-scale conditions, the model is shown to reproduce a wide range of mesoscale convective systems. Tropical cyclones grow from the most intense of these systems formed along the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and sometimes develop into hurricanes. The three-dimensional structure of simulated tropical cyclones is in excellent agreement with dropsondes and satellite observations. The mean seasonal and spatial distributions of TC genesis and occurrence are also in good agreement with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) data. It is noted, however, that the spatial pattern of TC activity is shifted to the northeast because of a similar bias in the environmental forcing. Over the whole genesis area, 8.2 ± 3.5 cyclones are produced seasonally in the model, compared with 6.6 ± 3.0 in the JTWC data. Part ...},

abstract = {Hailstorms represent one of the major sources of damage and insurance loss to residential, commercial, and agricultural assets in several parts of Central Europe. However, there is little knowledge of hail risk across Europe beyond local historical damage reports due to the relative rarity of severe hail events and the lack of uniform detection methods. Here we present a new stochastic catalog of hailstorms for Europe. It is based on satellite observations of overshooting cloud tops (OT) that indicate very strong convective updrafts and hail reports from the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD). Historic hail events are defined based on OT detections from satellite infrared brightness temperatures between 2004 and 2011 for the warm seasons (April–September). The satellite-based historical event properties are complemented by hailstone observations from ESWD to stochastically simulate more than 1 million individual events with an event footprint resolution of 10 km. The final hail event catalog presented in this paper is the first one with a spatial event distribution that is based on a single homogeneous observation source over Europe. Areas of high hail probability or hail risk are found over Central and Southern Europe, including mountainous regions such as the Alps or the Pyrenees. Another region of relatively high hail risk is present over central Eastern Europe.},

Differential radar reflectivity data indicate that the precipitation at upper levels was nearly glaciated early in the storm's lifetime. Dual-Doppler radar data show that throughout the storm's lifetime both updrafts and down-drafts were present at all altitudes and that most of the volume of the radar echo contained vertical velocities incapable of supporting precipitation-size particles.

This depolarization ratio can serve as a proxy for circular depolarization ratio (CDR) measured by radars with circular polarization.

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that rapid increases in total lightning activity (intracloud + cloud-to-ground) are often observed tens of minutes in advance of the occurrence of severe weather at the ground. These rapid increases in lightning activity have been termed “lightning jumps.” Herein, the authors document a positive correlation between lightning jumps and the manifestation of severe weather in thunderstorms occurring across the Tennessee Valley and Washington D.C. A total of 107 thunderstorms from the Tennessee Valley; Washington, D.C.; Dallas, Texas; and Houston, Texas, were examined in this study. Of the 107 thunderstorms, 69 thunderstorms fall into the category of nonsevere and 38 into the category of severe. From the dataset of 69 isolated nonsevere thunderstorms, an average, peak, 1-min flash rate of 10 flashes per minute was determined. A variety of severe thunderstorm types were examined for this study, including a mesoscale convective system, mesoscale convective vortex, tornadic outer rainbands of tropical remnants, supercells, and pulse severe thunderstorms. Of the 107 thunderstorms, 85 thunderstorms (47 nonsevere, 38 severe) were from the Tennessee Valley and Washington, D.C., and these 85 thunderstorms tested six lightning jump algorithm configurations (Gatlin, Gatlin 45, 2$\sigma$, 3$\sigma$, Threshold 10, and Threshold 8). Performance metrics for each algorithm were then calculated, yielding encouraging results from the limited sample of 85 thunderstorms. The 2$\sigma$ lightning jump algorithm had a high probability of detection (POD; 87%), a modest false-alarm rate (FAR; 33%), and a solid Heidke skill score (0.75). These statistics exceed current NWS warning statistics with this dataset; however, this algorithm needs further testing because there is a large difference in sample sizes. A second and more simplistic lightning jump algorithm named the Threshold 8 lightning jump algorithm also shows promise, with a POD of 81% and a FAR of 41%. Average lead times to severe weather occurrence for these two algorithms were 23 min. The overall goal of this study is to advance the development of an operationally applicable jump algorithm that can be used with either total lightning observations made from the ground, or in the near future from space using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Series R (GOES-R) Geostationary Lightning Mapper.},

abstract = {In previous studies published in the open literature, a strong relationship between the occurrence of hail and the microwave brightness temperatures (primarily at 37 and 85. GHz) was documented. These studies were performed with the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and most recently, the Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sensor. This led to climatologies of hail frequency from TMI and AMSR-E, however, limitations included geographical domain of the TMI sensor (35. S to 35. N) and the overpass time of the Aqua satellite (130. am/pm local time), both of which reduce an accurate mapping of hail events over the global domain and the full diurnal cycle. Nonetheless, these studies presented exciting, new applications for passive microwave sensors.NOAA and EUMETSAT have been operating the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A and -B) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) on several operational satellites since 1998: NOAA-15 through NOAA-19; MetOp-A and -B. With multiple satellites in operation since 2000, the AMSU/MHS sensors provide near global coverage every 4. h, thus, offering a much larger time and temporal sampling than TRMM or AMSR-E. With similar observation frequencies near 30 and 85. GHz, one at 157. GHz, and additionally three at the 183. GHz water vapor band, the potential to detect strong convection associated with severe storms on a more comprehensive time and space scale exists.In this study, we develop a prototype AMSU-based hail detection algorithm through the use of collocated satellite and surface hail reports over the continental US for a 10-year period (2000-2009). Compared with the surface observations, the algorithm detects approximately 40% of hail occurrences. The simple threshold algorithm is then used to generate a hail climatology based on all available AMSU observations during 2000-2011 that is stratified in several ways, including total hail occurrence by month (March through September), total annual, and over the diurnal cycle. Independent comparisons are made compared to similar data sets derived from other satellite, ground radar and surface reports. The algorithm was also applied to global land measurements for a single year and showed close agreement with other satellite based hail climatologies. Such a product could serve as a prototype for use with a future geostationary based microwave sensor such as NASA's proposed PATH mission.},

abstract = {A method for the parameterization of ice-phase microphysics is proposed and used to develop a new bulk microphysics scheme. All ice-phase particles are represented by several physical properties that evolve freely in time and space. The scheme prognoses four ice mixing ratio variables, total mass, rime mass, rime volume, and number, allowing 4 degrees of freedom for representing the particle properties using a single category. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach. The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that il-lustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

abstract = {The Mid-Ebro Valley (MEV) is an area of the northeast Iberian Peninsula with a large number of hailstorms throughout the year. Therefore, new forecasting tools are required to improve the spatiotemporal detection of such storms. Using a database of 100. days with severe storms (SSs) over a 13-year period between 2001 and 2013, we obtained vertical profiles predicted by the WRF mesoscale model. A total of 31 indexes describing conditions of humidity, stability, helicity or precipitable water were obtained from the profiles and input to a binary logistic regression model. The regression model was applied using the forward stepwise method, which indicated that the stability indexes were the most accurate for SS in the study area. Of the 31 indexes, 5 were selected: Showalter index (SI), wind speed at 500. hPa (SPD500), dew point temperature at 850. hPa (Td850), relative helicity between 0 and 3. km (SREH3km), and wet bulb zero height (WBZ). Combination of these indexes in a logistic equation gives the probability of SS risk/no risk in the study area. Results of the logistic equation show a Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.94 and a False Alarm Ratio (FAR) of 0.22. The second part of the article describes regionalization of the study area by SS spatial distribution according to the logistic equation. Thus, using multivariate techniques, we used principal component analysis (PCA) in T-mode and posterior cluster analysis, getting four clusters according to the spatial distribution of SS thermodynamic behavior and the distribution of storms observed via radar data. Clusters 1 and 2 showed probabilities of hail occurrence that were lower than Clusters 3 and 4, mainly affecting the MEV and the eastern end of the study area. Likewise, the predicted hail area was more extensive in those last two clusters. These results provide a new tool that complements those previously developed for this study area, toward improving SS prediction and pinpointing these storms in space and in time.},

abstract = {Proximity sounding analysis has long been a tool to determine environmental conditions associated with different kinds of weather events and to discriminate between them. It has been limited, necessarily, by the spatial and temporal distribution of soundings. The recent development of reanalysis datasets that cover the globe with spatial grid spacing on the order of 200 km and temporal spacing every 6 h allows for the possibility of increasing the number of proximity soundings by creating "pseudo-soundings." We have used the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)/United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis system to create soundings and find environmental conditions associated with significant severe thunderstorms (hail at least 5 cm in diameter, wind gusts at least 120 km h-1, or a tornado of at least F2 damage) and to discriminate between significant tornadic and non-tornadic thunderstorm environments in the eastern United States for the period 1997-1999. Applying the relationships from that region to Europe and the rest of the globe, we have made estimates of the frequency of favorable conditions for significant severe thunderstorms. Southern Europe has the greatest frequency of significant severe thunderstorm environments, particularly over the Spanish plateau and the region east of the Adriatic Sea. Favorable significant tornadic environments are found in France and east of the Adriatic. Worldwide, favorable significant thunderstorm environments are concentrated in equatorial Africa, the central United States, southern Brazil and northern Argentina, and near the Himalayas. Tornadic environments are by far the most common in the central United States, with lesser areas in southern Brazil and northern Argentina. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A laboratory investigation of electric charge transfer during the impact of vapour-grown ice crystals and supercooled water droplets upon a simulated soft-hailstone target has shown that the magnitude of the charge transferred to the riming surface when crystals separate from it is a function of temperature, crystal dimension, relative velocity, liquid water content, and impurity content of the water droplets and hence the impurity content of the riming target. The sign of the charge transfer depends on temperature, liquid water content and droplet and rime impurity content. In the absence of crystals, no charge transfer was detected during riming. In the absence of supercooled water droplets, crystals impacting at 10ms1 on an evaporating rime target produced a small negative charge on the rime of less than − 0.25fC per separating crystal. When the target surface grew by vapour diffusion it gained a small positive charge during such interactions. Much larger charges and completely different charge transfer behaviour was noted during riming. The target became positively charged at high liquid water contents and temperatures above a critical value, but negatively charged at lower temperatures or with lower liquid water contents. The critical sign reversal temperature at a liquid water content of 1 gm−3 was about − 20°C. At − 10°C with a liquid water content of 2gm−3, a 125 $\mu$m crystal impacting at 3ms−1 charged the target by +101C upon separation. The charge transfer increased sharply with impact speed and crystal size. Warming the positively charging rime to cause it to evaporate failed to reverse the sign of the charge transfer. Experiments with impurities showed that the sign reversal temperature increased if the droplets contained contaminants at concentrations found in cloud water. It is suggested that there are two distinct charge transfer processes during crystal interactions with an ice target, the dominant one requiring the presence of supercooled water droplets. Careful control and knowledge of the microphysical properties of the clouds used in these experimental simulations has permitted an examination of charge transfer under many of the conditions used in previous studies. The results provide an understanding of the differences and a reconciliation between some of the previously disparate findings in terms of the two distinct charge transfer regimes.},

abstract = {The detection efficiency (DE) is the most important performance gauge of a lightning detection network (LDN). Moreover, the main motivation for evaluating the DE of a LDN is to separate the geographical variations of the CG lightning parameters from the variations regarding the network performance. A review of previous relative DE techniques and simple methods to correct the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash density maps is presented. In addition, recent improvements in the flash DE model for the Brazilian lightning detection network (BrasilDAT) are discussed. The DE estimated values are based on the sensor individual DE probability functions, which are derived from a large amount of CG stroke data provided by the network considering different distances from the sensor and specific peak current ranges. The new approach provides better results when compared with the previous developments, since the calculation of the sensor DE probability functions neglects the lightning data provided by the minimum number of reporting sensors. Hence it is possible to minimize the unrealistic enhancement of the DE closer to the network boundaries ("border effect") without affecting significantly the performance inside the network. The main result is a more realistic correction of the CG flash density maps, particularly at the outermost network areas, leading to an improvement in the model sensitivity. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Para responder {\`{a}} essa pergunta, o objetivo deste trabalho foi identificar e quantificar a import{\^{a}}ncia de cada um desses efeitos na eletrifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos sistemas convectivos da Amaz{\^{o}}nia. A metodologia foi baseada em an{\'{a}}lises de dados observacionais do experimento de campo DRYTOWET e em um modelo num{\'{e}}rico com parametriza{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de transfer{\^{e}}ncias de cargas e descargas el{\'{e}}tricas. A an{\'{a}}lise do ciclo anual das descargas el{\'{e}}tricas do tipo nuvem-solo (CGs) mostrou que a atividade el{\'{e}}trica dos sistemas precipitantes da regi{\~{a}}o sudoeste da Amaz{\^{o}}nia aumenta durante a transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da esta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o seca para a esta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o chuvosa (Agosto a Setembro), associada aos sistemas convectivos com maior desenvolvimento vertical que acontecem nesse per{\'{i}}odo.

A porcentagem desses totais de CGs que tinham polaridade positiva (+CGs) tem m{\'{e}}dia de 12% durante todo o ano, aumentando drasticamente para at{\'{e}} 25% em Setembro, durante a transi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre as esta{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es secas e chuvosa.

Com altura da base da nuvem mais elevada, a espessura da camada quente (ECQ - base da nuvem at{\'{e}} a isoterma de 0oC) diminui, aumentando assim a velocidade das correntes ascendentes atrav{\'{e}}s de um melhor processamento da energia potencial dispon{\'{i}}vel para convec{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o (CAPE) devido a um menor entranhamento.

The SP-LMA was operational from November 2011 through March 2012. Sensor spacing was on the order of 15-30 km, with a network diameter on the order of 40-50km. The SP-LMA provides good 3-D lightning mapping out to150 km from the network center, with 2-D coverage considerably farther. In addition to supporting CHUVA science/mission objectives, the SP-LMA is supporting the generation of unique proxy data for the Geostationary Lightning Mapper and Advanced Baseline Imager , on NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R . These proxy data will be used to develop and validate operational algorithms so that they will be ready to use on "day1" following the GOES-R launch. The SP-LMA data also will be intercompared with lightning observations from other deployed lightning networks to advance our understanding of the capabilities/contributions of each of these networks toward GLM proxy and validation activities.

abstract = {The UK Met Office Unified Model (UM) is employed by many weather forecasting agencies around the globe. This model is designed to run across spatial and time scales and known to produce skillful predictions for large-scale weather systems. However, the model has only recently begun running operationally at horizontal grid spacings of ∼1.5 km [e.g., at the UK Met Office and the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)]. As its microphysics scheme was originally designed and tuned for large-scale precipitation systems, we investigate the performance of UM microphysics to determine potential inherent biases or weaknesses. Two rainfall cases from the KMA forecasting system are considered in this study: a Changma (quasi-stationary) front, and Typhoon Sanba (2012). The UM output is compared to polarimetric radar observations in terms of simulated polarimetric radar variables. Results show that the UM generally underpredicts median reflectivity in stratiform rain, producing high reflectivity cores and precipitation gaps between them. This is partially due to the diagnostic rain intercept parameter formulation used in the one-moment microphysics scheme. Model drop size is generally both under-and overpredicted compared to observations. UM frozen hydrometeors favor generic ice (crystals and snow) rather than graupel, which is reasonable for Changma and typhoon cases. The model performed best with the typhoon case in terms of simulated precipitation coverage.},

abstract = {Four distinct meteorological regimes in the Amazon basin have been examined to distinguish the contributions from boundary layer aerosol and convective available potential energy (CAPE) to continental cloud structure and electrification. The lack of distinction in the electrical parameters (peak flash rate, lightning yield per unit rainfall) between aerosol-rich October and aerosol-poor November in the premonsoon regime casts doubt on a primary role for the aerosol in enhancing cloud electrification. Evidence for a substantial role for the aerosol in suppressing warm rain coalescence is identified in the most highly polluted period in early October. The electrical activity in this stage is qualitatively peculiar. During the easterly and westerly wind regimes of the wet season, the lightning yield per unit of rainfall is positively correlated with the aerosol concentration, but the electrical parameters are also correlated with CAPE, with a similar degree of scatter. Here cause and effect are difficult to establish with available observations. This ambiguity extends to the "green ocean" westerly regime, a distinctly maritime regime over a major continent with minimum aerosol concentration, minimum CAPE, and little if any lightning.},

abstract = {Many studies from the last decades have shown that airborne microorganisms can be intrinsically linked to atmospheric processes. Certain bacteria may constitute the most active ice nuclei found in the atmosphere and might have some influence on the formation of ice crystals in clouds. This study deals with the ice nucleation activity of Pseudomonas syringae inside of thunderstorms through numerical simulations using BRAMS (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Model System). The numerical simulations were developed in order to investigate the effect on the total amount of rainwater as a function of ice nuclei (IN) P. syringae concentrations with different scenarios (classified as S2 to S4 scenarios) corresponding to a maximum of 102 to 104 IN bacteria per liter of cloud water plus the BRAMS default (classified as S5 scenario). Additionally, two other scenarios were included without any IN (S1) and the sum of RAMS default and S4 scenario (classified as S6). The chosen radiosonde data is for 3 March 2003, typical summertime in S{\~{a}}o Paulo City which presents a strong convective cell. The objective of the simulations was to analyze the effect of the IN concentrations on the BRAMS modeled cloud properties and precipitation. The simulated electrification of the cloud permitted analysis of the total flashes estimated from precipitable and non-precipitable ice mass fluxes in two different lightning frequencies. Among all scenarios, only S4 and S6 presented a tendency to decrease the total cloud water, and all bacteria scenarios presented a tendency to decrease the total amount of rain (−8%), corroborating other reports in the literature. All bacteria scenarios also present higher precipitable ice concentrations compared to S5 scenario, the RAMS default. The main results present the total flash number per simulation as well. From the results, the total flash numbers, from both lightning frequencies, in S4 and S6 scenarios, are from 3.1 to 3.7 higher than the BRAMS default. Even the lower bacterial concentrations (scenarios S2 and S3) produced 3 time higher number of flashes, compared to S5 scenario. This result is a function of the hydrometeors in each simulation. In conclusion, IN bacteria could affect directly the thunderstorm structure and lightning formation with many other microphysical implications.},

abstract = {This study investigated the physical processes involved in the development of thunderstorms over southwestern Amazon by hypothesizing causalities for the observed cloud-to-ground lightning variability and the local environmental characteristics. Southwestern Amazon experiences every year a large variety of environmental factors, such as the gradual increase in atmospheric moisture, extremely high pollution due to biomass burning, and intense deforestation, which directly affects cloud development by differential surface energy partition. In the end of the dry period it was observed higher percentages of positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning due to a relative increase in +CG dominated thunderstorms (positive thunderstorms). Positive (negative) thunderstorms initiated preferentially over deforested (forest) areas with higher (lower) cloud base heights, shallower (deeper) warm cloud depths, and higher (lower) convective potential available energy. These features characterized the positive (negative) thunderstorms as deeper (relatively shallower) clouds, stronger (relatively weaker) updrafts with enhanced (decreased) mixed and cold vertically integrated liquid. No significant difference between thunderstorms (negative and positive) and nonthunderstorms were observed in terms of atmospheric pollution, once the atmosphere was overwhelmed by pollution leading to an updraft-limited regime. However, in the wet season both negative and positive thunderstorms occurred during periods of relatively higher aerosol concentration and differentiated size distributions, suggesting an aerosol-limited regime where cloud electrification could be dependent on the aerosol concentration to suppress the warm and enhance the ice phase. The suggested causalities are consistent with the invoked hypotheses, but they are not observed facts; they are just hypotheses based on plausible physical mechanisms.},

The empirical estimates of these coefficients were a factor of 1.5?2 times larger than predicted by prior scattering simulations.

abstract = {A fully coupled "online" Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model has been developed. The air quality component of the model is fully consistent with the meteorological component; both components use the same transport scheme (mass and scalar preserving), the same grid (horizontal and vertical components), and the same physics schemes for subgrid-scale transport. The components also use the same timestep, hence no temporal interpolation is needed. The chemistry package consists of dry deposition ("flux-resistance" method), biogenic emission as in [Simpson et al., 1995. Journal of Geophysical Research 100D, 22875-22890; Guenther et al., 1994. Atmospheric Environment 28, 1197-1210], the chemical mechanism from RADM2, a complex photolysis scheme (Madronich scheme coupled with hydrometeors), and a state of the art aerosol module (MADE/SORGAM aerosol parameterization). The WRF/Chem model is statistically evaluated and compared to MM5/Chem and to detailed photochemical data collected during the summer 2002 NEAQS field study. It is shown that the WRF/Chem model is statistically better skilled in forecasting O3 than MM5/Chem, with no appreciable differences between models in terms of bias with the observations. Furthermore, the WRF/Chem model consistently exhibits better skill at forecasting the O 3 precursors CO and NOy at all of the surface sites. However, the WRF/Chem model biases of these precursors and of other gas-phase species are persistently higher than for MM5/Chem, and are most often biased high compared to observations. Finally, we show that the impact of other basic model assumptions on these same statistics can be much larger than the differences caused by model differences. An example showing the sensitivity of various statistical measures with respect to the treatment of biogenic volatile organic compounds emissions illustrates this impact. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Documenting simultaneous multiparameter radar observations of precipitation in conjunction with in situ hydrometeor sampling is important for the interpretation of multiparameter radar observations. In situ observation using aircraft-mounted probes is one of the best ways to collect such data. In situ observation of hail and graupel in convective storms is complicated due to adverse environment of flight and low concentration of large particles that are difficult to sample. This paper presents one of the first observations of simultaneous multiparameter radar observations and in situ samples of wet hail and graupel in convective storms. The observations are unique because of the excellent coordination between aircraft samples and radar scanning, as well as relatively large sample volumes of aircraft data. Multiparameter radar observations (namely reflectivity, differential reflectivity, linear depolarization ratio, copolar correlation coefficient, and specific differential phase) are documented in graupel and wet hail. The observations indicate that the linear depolarization ratio and copolar correlation measurements, in conjunction with reflectivity levels, can be used to distinguish between graupel and hail. A simple procedure is developed to estimate the average bulk density of graupel and wet hail, comparing radar and in situ observations},

Graupel occurs simultaneously with all types of snow crystals, but individual crystal types do not consistently occur with or serve as kernels for particles of graupel.Graupel particles do not develop predominantly on kernel snow crystals that grow to relatively large sizes over relatively long periods by deposition and accretion. Graupel often forms instead on a select few small crystals, when it forms utilizing regular crystals as kernels. Graupel frequently develops without kernels, by alternate riming processes. One possible alternative is a mechanism that produces graupel from rime accumulated at localized points on parent snow crystals.},

abstract = {In France, the melting level height varies, during the hail season, from about 1 km in the spring to more than 4 km in the summer, and this parameter appears to have a connection with the mean characteristics of hailfalls. In fact, a large 25-year sample of hail size distribution measurements, made with hailpad networks along the southern Atlantic coast, reveals strong correlations between the melting level height and the mean hailstone number in different hailstone diameter ranges. On average, an increase in the melting level height is associated with a decrease in the number of small hailstones (5 to 7 mm diameter), has no apparent effect in the middle range (7 to 9 mm), and is concomitant with an increase in the number of larger hailstones, particularly in the 11 to 21 mm ranges. When the relationships giving the hailstone number in each diameter range as a function of the melting level height are applied to a given hailfall, an increase in the melting level height is then found to go together with changes in the total hailstone number and kinetic energy. From this observation, it is possible to estimate the potential effect of global warming on hailfalls with different hailstone size distributions. The trends in the monthly surface temperature and in the hail day melting level height observed at Bordeaux during the 1988-2012 period and the global warming projections made for the present century suggest that an increase in the melting level height of 500 m is forecast to occur in this region between 2000 and 2040. The consequences of such an increase for a standard hailfall in the region will be a slight decrease (-12%) in the total number of hailstones, and a significant increase (40%) in total kinetic energy, but with no significant change in the hail frequency. This analysis is compared to the already observed increase in hail intensity in the area under study, and to observations, measurements, and numerical models in other parts of the world.},

abstract = {Statistical and case study–oriented comparisons of the quantitative precipitation nowcasting (QPN) schemes demonstrated during the first World Weather Research Programme (WWRP) Forecast Demonstration Project (FDP), held in Sydney, Australia, during 2000, served to confirm many of the earlier reported findings regarding QPN algorithm design and performance. With a few notable exceptions, nowcasting algorithms based upon the linear extrapolation of observed precipitation motion (Lagrangian persistence) were generally superior to more sophisticated, nonlinear nowcasting methods. Centroid trackers [Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis and Nowcasting System (TITAN)] and pattern matching extrapolators using multiple vectors (Auto-nowcaster and Nimrod) were most reliable in convective scenarios. During widespread, stratiform rain events, the pattern matching extrapolators were superior to centroid trackers and wind advection techniques (Gandolf, Nimrod). There is some limited case study and statistical evidence from the FDP to support the use of more sophisticated, nonlinear QPN algorithms. In a companion paper in this issue, Wilson et al. demonstrate the advantages of combining linear extrapolation with algorithms designed to predict convective initiation, growth, and decay in the Auto-nowcaster. Ebert et al. show that the application of a nonlinear scheme [Spectral Prognosis (S-PROG)] designed to smooth precipitation features at a rate consistent with their observed temporal persistence tends to produce a nowcast that is superior to Lagrangian persistence in terms of rms error. However, the value of this approach in severe weather forecasting is called into question due to the rapid smoothing of high-intensity precipitation features.},

abstract = {We examine downward leader characteristics for negative first return strokes, along with estimated first stroke peak currents, for lightning occurring over land and ocean reported by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we report independent evidence that supports the observations by lightning locating systems of higher first stroke peak currents for lightning occurring over ocean than land. We analyzed lightning occurring in five circular regions, each with 50 km diameter. In western Florida, the median stepped-leader duration was 17% shorter over ocean than over land and in eastern Florida the median durations were 21% and 39% shorter over two oceanic regions than over land. We infer that the shorter durations over ocean simply reflect the higher (25% in western Florida and 11%–16% in eastern Florida) oceanic return stroke peak currents reported by the NLDN. These findings indicate that the cloud charge structure for (at least some) oceanic storms are different than those for storms over land. The percentage of flashes that had at least one NLDN-reported negative cloud pulse prior to the first negative cloud-to-ground stroke was found to be about the same over land and ocean. Using regression analysis, we found no evidence that the relationship between leader duration and first return stroke peak current is different over land and ocean.},

abstract = {AbstractIce-phase precipitation occurs at Earth's surface and may include various types of pristine crystals, rimed crystals, freezing droplets, secondary crystals, aggregates, graupel, hail, or combinations of any of these. Formation of ice-phase precipitation is directly related to environmental and cloud meteorological parameters that include available moisture, temperature, and three-dimensional wind speed and turbulence, as well as processes related to nucleation, cooling rate, and microphysics. Cloud microphysical parameters in the numerical models are resolved based on various processes such as nucleation, mixing, collision and coalescence, accretion, riming, secondary ice particle generation, turbulence, and cooling processes. These processes are usually parameterized based on assumed particle size distributions and ice crystal microphysical parameters such as mass, size, and number and mass density. Microphysical algorithms in the numerical models are developed based on their need for applications. Observations of ice-phase precipitation are performed using in situ and remote sensing platforms, including radars and satellite-based systems. Because of the low density of snow particles with small ice water content, their measurements and predictions at the surface can include large uncertainties. Wind and turbulence affecting collection efficiency of the sensors, calibration issues, and sensitivity of ground-based in situ observations of snow are important challenges to assessing the snow precipitation. This chapter's goals are to provide an overview for accurately measuring and predicting ice-phase precipitation. The processes within and below cloud that affect falling snow, as well as the known sources of error that affect understanding and prediction of these processes, are discussed.},

abstract = {Thunderstorms are convective systems characterised by the occurrence of lightning. Lightning and thunderstorm activity has been increasingly studied in recent years in relation to the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and various other large-scale modes of atmospheric and oceanic variability. Large-scale modes of variability can sometimes be predictable several months in advance, suggesting potential for seasonal forecasting of lightning and thunderstorm activity in various regions throughout the world. To investigate this possibility, seasonal lightning activity in the world's tropical and temperate regions is examined here in relation to numerous different large-scale modes of variability. Of the seven modes of variability examined, ENSO has the strongest relationship with lightning activity during each individual season, with relatively little relationship for the other modes of variability. A measure of ENSO variability (the NINO3.4 index) is significantly correlated to local lightning activity at 53% of locations for one or more seasons throughout the year. Variations in atmospheric parameters commonly associated with thunderstorm activity are found to provide a plausible physical explanation for the variations in lightning activity associated with ENSO. It is demonstrated that there is potential for accurately predicting lightning and thunderstorm activity several months in advance in various regions throughout the world.},

abstract = {An 8-year analysis of hailstorms is presented. A comprehensive set of six hundred hailstorms that occurred in 172 different days in various parts of Germany is used to characterise these events. The analysed observations include measurements from a lightning location system, precipitation radar, as well as information from automated cell detection algorithms based on radar reflectivity and radial winds which are combined with severe weather reports. Additionally to the storms' parameters during the time of the observed hail, the temporal evolution of the storms' characteristics is analysed in order to study the convective life-cycle and identify parameters with predictive skill. A special focus is on the lightning characteristics of the convective cells. A feature that is shown to occur in many of the analysed severe hail cases is the lightning jump, i.e., a rapid increase in the total lightning density. It occurs well before the observed hail and has thus a great potential to increase the lead time of warnings of severe hail events. Instead of fixed thresholds for the definition of a lightning jump, a lightning jump intensity parameter is introduced and tested. The analysis also reveals that half to the storms show a pulsating lightning activity. Nearly three quarters of the hail events are associated with a mesocyclone that was automatically detected in radar data. As expected, high reflectivity values were measured during the time of the observed hail.},

abstract = {A 5-cm wavelength (C band) polarimetric radar was deployed during the MCTEX (Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment) field program. This paper investigates the use of the C-band data for quantitative rainfall measurements with particular emphasis on specific differential phase (KDP) and traditional reflectivity-based rain-rate estimates in moderate to high rain rates (10-200 mm/h). Large values of backscatter differential phase shift are occasionally seen in these data, thus resonance scattering effects are important. A consensus algorithm for KDP estimation in these cases is described. The rain-rate estimates are compared with the data from a d-scale rain gauge network. The KDP estimates are shown to produce the highest quality data, although variations in drop size distribution characteristics have a significant effect on the rain estimates. When corrections are applied for beam blockage and attenuation, good agreement can also be obtained with Z?R-based estimates. The attenuation corrections were made using a polarimetric variable, total differential phase, which provides an estimate of the total water content along the path. The polarimetric estimates of total accumulation also show excellent agreement.},

abstract = {It is shown that total lightning mapping, along with radar and National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) cloud-to-ground lightning data, can be used to diagnose the severity of a thunderstorm. Analysis of supercells, some of which were tornadic, on 13 October 2001 over Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas, shows that Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR II) lightning source heights (quartile, median, and 95th percentile heights) increased as the storms intensified. Most of the total (cloud to ground and intracloud) lightning occurred where reflectivity cores extended upward, within regions of strong reflectivity gradient rather than in reflectivity cores. A total lightning hole was associated with an intense, nontornadic supercell on 6 April 2003. None of the supercells on 13 October 2001 exhibited a lightning hole. During tornadogenesis, the radar andLDARII data indicated updraft weakening. The height of the 30-dBZ radar top began to descend approximately 10 min (2 volume scans) before tornado touchdown in one storm. Total lightning and cloud-to-ground flash rates decreased by up to a factor of 5 to a minimum during an F2 tornado touchdown associated with this storm. LDAR II source heights all showed descent by 2–4 km during a 25-min period prior to and during this tornado touchdown. This drastic trend of decreasing source heights prior to and during tornado touchdown was observed in two storms, but did not occur in nontornadic supercells, suggesting that these parameters can be useful to forecasters. These observations agree with tornadogenesis theory that as the updraft weakens, the mesocyclone can divide (into an updraft and downdraft) and become tornadic.},

The technique is tested using emulated radial wind observations of a supercell storm simulated by the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), as well as real dual-Doppler observations of a supercell storm that occurred in Oklahoma on 8 May 2003. Special attention is given to procedures to evaluate the vorticity tendency term, including spatially variable advection correction and estimation of the intrinsic evolution. Volume scan times ranging from 5 min, typical of operational radar networks, down to 30 s, achievable by rapid-scan mobile radars, are considered.

Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of hail, the proper detection of hail occurrences is almost impossible using ground station reports alone. An alternate approach uses information from weather radars. Several algorithms that use single-polarisation radar data have been developed for hail detection. In the present study, seven algorithms were tested on well documented recent hail events from Czechia and southwest Germany from 2002 to 2011. The study aimed to find the optimal threshold values for the applications of these techniques over the Czech territory and for evaluating the climatology of hail events. The results showed that the Waldvogel technique and the NEXRAD severe hail algorithm were the most accurate methods for hail detection over the area of interest. A combined criterion was proposed based on a combination of previously tested techniques. The precision of this "combi-criterion" was demonstrated for a severe hail event. The abilities of the tested criteria to provide information about a hail-fall area distribution and hail damage risk over the Czech territory were shown and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the present study, three meteorological events of extreme deep moist convection, characteristic of south-eastern South America, are considered to conduct a system-atic evaluation of the microphysical parameterizations avail-able in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by undertaking a direct comparison between satellite-based simulated and observed microwave radiances. A research radiative transfer model, the Atmospheric Radiative Trans-fer Simulator (ARTS), is coupled with the WRF model un-der three different microphysical parameterizations (WSM6, WDM6 and Thompson schemes). Microwave radiometry has shown a promising ability in the characterization of frozen hydrometeors. At high microwave frequencies, how-ever, frozen hydrometeors significantly scatter radiation, and the relationship between radiation and hydrometeor popu-lations becomes very complex. The main difficulty in mi-crowave remote sensing of frozen hydrometeor characteri-zation is correctly characterizing this scattering signal due to the complex and variable nature of the size, composition and shape of frozen hydrometeors. The present study further aims at improving the understanding of frozen hydrometeor opti-cal properties characteristic of deep moist convection events in south-eastern South America. In the present study, bulk optical properties are computed by integrating the single-scattering properties of the Liu (2008) discrete dipole ap-proximation (DDA) single-scattering database across the par-ticle size distributions parameterized by the different WRF schemes in a consistent manner, introducing the equal mass approach. The equal mass approach consists of describing the optical properties of the WRF snow and graupel hy-drometeors with the optical properties of habits in the DDA database whose dimensions might be different (D max) but whose mass is conserved. The performance of the radiative transfer simulations is evaluated by comparing the simula-tions with the available coincident microwave observations up to 190 GHz (with observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S)) using the $\chi$ 2 test. Good agreement is obtained with all observations provided special care is taken to represent the scattering properties of the snow and graupel species.},

The idea is that, with increasing upper-level shear (ULS), hydrometeors are transported farther from the updraft by stronger storm-relative anvil-level winds, limiting their growth and thereby reducing precipitation intensity. The present study represents the first attempt to test this hypothesis, using idealized simulations of supercells performed across a range of 6–12-km shear profiles.Contrary to expectations, there is a significant increase in surface precipitation and an associated strengthening of outflow winds as ULS magnitude is increased from 0 to 20 m s−1. These changes result from an increase in storm motion, which drives stronger low-level inflow, a wider updraft, and enhanced condensation. A further...},

Polarimetric radar variables measured in the presence of hail at C band are quite different from the ones at S band due to more pronounced effects of resonance scattering and much stronger impact of attenuation. The differences are particularly strong in melting hail below the freezing level, but they can be substantial even at higher altitudes where hail is dry or grows in wet regime. As a consequence, the algorithms for hail detection and determination of its size developed at S band can't be directly applied to C band. Differences between vertical profiles of radar reflectivity Z, differential reflectivity ZDR, and cross-correlation coefficient $\rho$hv in hail-bearing parts of the storms have been examined for large and giant hail. It is shown that in the presence of hail, ZDR(C) is usually higher than ZDR(S) and $\rho$hv(C)<$\rho$hv(S). The height of radar resolution volume with respect to the freezing level has to be taken into account in polarimetric hail detection/sizing. It is also demonstrated that giant hail is commonly associated with pronounced depression of $\rho$hv in the areas of hail generation above the freezing level and the corresponding drop in $\rho$hv at C band is much stronger than at S band. These results are compared to C-band polarimetric data collected in hail-bearing thunderstorms in Austria, where additional small hail size reports are available. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dual-Doppler observations with unprecedented finescale spatial and temporal resolution are used to characterize the vector wind field in and near a tornado occurring near Kiefer, Oklahoma, on 26 May 1997. Analyses of the dual-Doppler vector wind fields document in detail, for the first time, several structures associated with the tornado: a proximate updraft region, a rear-flank downdraft wrapping around the tornado, a double gust front structure occluding near the tornado, and a region of enhanced vorticity separated from the tornado that may have been associated with cyclic tornadogenesis. The analyses are compared to conceptual and computer models of tornadic storms.A subsequent tornadogenesis was observed with radar every 18 s, providing a finescale temporal view of the genesis process. The genesis process was complex and the evolution of tornado intensity parameters was not monotonic in time. Low-level rotation contracted and intensified, then broadened, then contracted and intensified a second time to form the tornado.The initial tornadogenesis was coincident with the merger of the main supercell and a much smaller convective storm. This tornado, which was always surrounded by substantial precipitation originating from both storms, began to dissipate just a few minutes after genesis, and the rotation both aloft and near the surface weakened substantially. A second storm merger, with a much larger and supercellular storm, was coincident with a reintensification of the mesocyclone aloft, a new hook echo development, and the genesis of a short-lived tornado. After the dissipation of this second tornado, the merger disrupted the structure of the supercell storm, the hook echo was absorbed, and the mesocyclone dissipated. The current analysis suggests a process in which storm mergers may, in sequence, aid tornadogenesis by enhancing surface convergence, or through another mechanism, but subsequently disrupt the tornado&#8217;s parent supercell perhaps by cooling the inflow air, with the result being short-lived tornadoes.},

The information is valid for a 10-cm wavelength and consists of relations that are based on an extensive list of previous and recent observational and modeling studies of polarimetric signatures of hydrometeors. The relations are expressed as boundaries and thresholds in a space of polarimetric radar variables. Thus, the foundation is laid out for identification of hydrometeor types (species), estimation of characteristics of hydrometeor species (size, concentrations, etc.), and quantification of bulk hydrometeor contents (amounts). A fuzzy classification algorithm that builds upon this foundation will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

The present study delves into the analysis of the relationship between Lightning Jump alerts and hail occurrence, through the analysis of lightning and radar variables in the moment when the warning is issued. Overall, the study has consisted of the analysis of 149 cases, grouping them into two categories according to hail size: small and large hail, with a threshold of 2 cm of diameter. The thunderstorms related to big sized hail presented remarkable differences in some of the variables analysed that could help forecast the size of hail when the LJ alert is triggered. Moreover, other variables have been allowed to observe and to corroborate how the LJ algorithm works during the 13 min before the warning is triggered.},

abstract = {AbstractRainfall retrieval algorithms often assume a gamma-shaped raindrop size distribution (DSD) with three mathematical parameters Nw, Dm, and ?. If only two independent measurements are available, as with the dual-frequency precipitation radar on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission core satellite, then retrieval algorithms are underconstrained and require assumptions about DSD parameters. To reduce the number of free parameters, algorithms can assume that ? is either a constant or a function of Dm. Previous studies have suggested ??? constraints [where ? = (4 + ?)/Dm], but controversies exist over whether ??? constraints result from physical processes or mathematical artifacts due to high correlations between gamma DSD parameters. This study avoids mathematical artifacts by developing joint probability distribution functions (joint PDFs) of statistically independent DSD attributes derived from the raindrop mass spectrum. These joint PDFs are then mapped into gamma-shaped DSD parameter joint PDFs that can be used in probabilistic rainfall retrieval algorithms as proposed for the GPM satellite program. Surface disdrometer data show a high correlation coefficient between the mass spectrum mean diameter Dm and mass spectrum standard deviation $\sigma$m. To remove correlations between DSD attributes, a normalized mass spectrum standard deviation is constructed to be statistically independent of Dm, with representing the most likely value and std representing its dispersion. Joint PDFs of Dm and ? are created from Dm and . A simple algorithm shows that rain-rate estimates had smaller biases when assuming the DSD breadth of than when assuming a constant ?.},

Here, using a novel modelling approach, we investigate the spatiotemporal changes in hail frequency and size between the present (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070). Although fewer hail days are expected over most areas in the future, an increase in the mean hail size is projected, with fewer small hail events and a shift toward a more frequent occurrence of larger hail. This leads to an anticipated increase in hail damage potential over most southern regions in spring, retreating to the higher latitudes (that is, north of 50[deg][thinsp]N) and the Rocky Mountains in the summer. In contrast, a dramatic decrease in hail frequency and damage potential is predicted over eastern and southeastern regions in spring and summer due to a significant increase in melting that mitigates gains in hail size from increased buoyancy.},

A new algorithm for discrimination between small hail (with maximal size of less than 2.5 cm), large hail (with diameters between 2.5 and 5.0 cm), and giant hail with size exceeding 5.0 cm is proposed and implemented for applications with the S-band dual-polarization Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) systems. The fuzzy-logic algorithm is based on the combined use of radar reflectivity Z, differential reflectivity ZDR, and cross-correlation coefficient $\rho$hv. The parameters of the membership functions depend on the height of the radar resolution volume with respect to the freezing level, exploiting the size-dependent melting characteristics of hailstones. The attenuation effects in melting hail are quantified in this study, and a novel technique for polarimetric attenuation correction in the presence of hail is suggested. The use of a rainfall estimator that is based on specific differential phase KDP is justified on the basis of the results of theoretical simulations and comparison of actual radar retrievals at S band with gauge measurements for storms containing large hail with diameters exceeding 2.5 cm.},

abstract = {Polarimetric radar observations of deep convective storms frequently reveal columnar enhancements of differential reflectivity Z DR . Such ''Z DR columns'' can extend upward more than 3 km above the environ-mental 08C level, indicative of supercooled liquid drops being lofted by the updraft. Previous observational and modeling studies of Z DR columns are reviewed. To address remaining questions, the Hebrew University Cloud Model, an advanced spectral bin microphysical model, is coupled with a polarimetric radar operator to simulate the formation and life cycle of Z DR columns in a deep convective continental storm. In doing so, the mechanisms by which Z DR columns are produced are clarified, including the formation of large raindrops in the updraft by recirculation of smaller raindrops formed aloft back into the updraft at low levels. The internal hy-drometeor structure of Z DR columns is quantified, revealing the transition from supercooled liquid drops to freezing drops to hail with height in the Z DR column. The life cycle of Z DR columns from early formation, through growth to maturity, to demise is described, showing how hail falling out through the weakening or ascending updraft bubble dominates the reflectivity factor Z H , causing the death of the Z DR column and leaving behind its ''ghost'' of supercooled drops. In addition, the practical applications of Z DR columns and their evolution are explored. The height of the Z DR column is correlated with updraft strength, and the evolution of Z DR column height is correlated with increases in Z H and hail mass content at the ground after a lag of 10–15 min.},

Attempts have been made to systematize presentation of the information. This is possible only up to a point, however, since it was received in a multiplicity of forms, some of which defy conventional climatological handling.

abstract = {On 5 September 2015 a violent hailstorm hit the Gulf and the city of Naples in Italy. The storm originated over the Tyrrhenian Sea dropping 7–10cm diameter hailstones along its path. During its mature phase, at 08:47 UTC, the hailstorm was captured by one overpass of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission Core Observatory (GPM-CO) embarking the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and the Ka/Ku-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). In this paper, observations by both GMI and DPR are thoroughly analyzed in conjunction with other spaceborne and ground-based measurements, to show how the GPM-CO integrates established observational tools in monitoring, understanding, and characterizing severe weather. Rapid-scan MSG SEVIRI images show an extremely rapid development, with 10.8$\mu$m cloud-top temperatures dropping by 65K in 40min down to 198K. The LIghtning NETwork registered over 37,000 strokes in 5h, with intracloud positive strokes fraction increasing during the regeneration phases, when ground-based polarimetric radar and DPR support the presence of large graupel/hail particles. DPR Ku 40dBZ and 20dBZ echo top heights at 14km and 16km, respectively, indicate strong updraft and deep overshooting. GMI extremely low brightness temperatures (TBs) in correspondence of the convective core (158, 97, 67, and 87K at 19, 37, 89 and 166GHz) are compatible with the presence of massive ice particles. In two years of GPM global observations the storm ranks as fourth and first in terms of minimum 37 and 19GHz (V-pol) TBs, respectively. This study illustrates GPM-CO sensing capabilities for characterizing the structure of such severe hailstorm, while providing observational evidence of its intensity and rarity, globally, and, in particular, in the Mediterranean area.},

abstract = {The detection of hail precipitation generated by a storm is a complicated task due to the limited spatial extension and the space-time irregularity of impacts generated on the ground. Some of the most extensive methods to create climatology of these impacts are observer networks or hailpad networks. Both methods are affected by numerous inconveniences, overall when it is necessary to work with an extensive area, in which it is necessary to maintain an operating network that has numerous maintenance costs. In this sense, there are numerous works done that have developed different models with the objective of detecting hail precipitation using meteorological radar. Some of these methods use discriminant statistic techniques that, through the combination of different radar parameters, can achieve very satisfactory results. On the other hand, it would be very interesting to know not only the probability of hail, but also some of the characteristics of the hailstones precipitated, such as the number or their kinetic energy, since these parameters are directly related to the damage generated in infrastructures and/or crops. The estimation of kinetic energy of hail precipitation using meteorological radar has caught the interest of some authors. In our case, we used the databases obtained by hailpad networks and the databases of C-band and S-Band radar to build an algorithm to estimate the vertical component of kinetic energy produced by a hail precipitation. In order to carry out this study, data on hail was gathered and analyzed from the hailpad networks in the province of Zaragoza (in the north-east of Spain) and the province of Mendoza (in Argentina, close to the Andes range on the border with Chile). These are two geographically distant regions, but which share a common characteristic: a high frequency of storms with hail precipitation, mainly during the summer months (S{\'{a}}nchez et al., 2009a). In order to compile the database, we have established two categories of kinetic energy: hail with low energy (<20Jm-2) and hail with high energy (>20Jm-2). With this information, we have looked to establish a differentiation between hail precipitation that hardly produces damage and, on the contrary, that which does (Dessens et al., 2007). Once these two categories were established, we constructed a logistic function that establishes a correspondence between radar variables and the two categories of kinetic energy. The results show great uncertainty in determining kinetic energy using C-band radar. However, for the S-band radar the results have shown that the probability of detection is 85.7% with a FAR of 14.3% and an explained variance of 61.2%. This result allows us, with corresponding caution, to make a first estimation of the areas in which a hailstorm could produce damage. With the objective of making a meteorological interpretation of the results obtained (achieved only using statistic criteria), we have previously done an Principal Components Analysis (PCA). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Use of the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) framework in dual-Doppler wind analysis (DDA) offers several advantages over traditional techniques. Perhaps the most important is that the errors that result from explicit integration of the mass continuity equation in traditional methods are avoided. In this study, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are used to compare supercell thunderstorm wind retrievals from a 3DVARDDAtechnique and three traditionalDDAmethods. The 3DVAR technique produces better wind retrievals near the top of the storm than the traditional methods in the experiments. This is largely attributed to the occurrence of severe errors aloft in the traditional retrievals whether the continuity equation integration proceeds upward (due to vertically accumulating errors), downward (due to severe boundary condition errors arising from uncertainty in the horizontal divergence field aloft), or in both directions. Smaller, but statistically significant, improvement occurs near the ground using the 3DVARmethod. When lack of upper-level observations prevents application of a top boundary condition in the traditional DDA framework, the 3DVAR approach produces better analyses at all levels. These results strongly suggest the 3DVAR DDA framework is generally preferable to traditional formulations. {\textcopyright}2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The Romanian National Meteorological Administration (NMA) radar network consists of five S-band and four C-band radars. Observation of convection in Romania through the Doppler radar network offered a new perspective in understanding the climatologic risk of certain regions and mesoscale environments. Highly organized convective systems, such as supercells, are better observed and their subsequent threat can be better anticipated during the nowcasting process using Doppler velocity fields and detection algorithms such as mesocyclones (MESO) and tornadic vortex signature (TVS). However, for warning purposes, these tools cannot be used without a subjective validation because of the associated errors and limitations of radar observations. In this paper several cases are presented where the presence of large hail inside the storm produced a radar artifact named three-body scatter signature (TBSS) that disturbed the Doppler velocity field. The cases presented were observed with S-band radars and were associated with hail reports on the ground. The first case shows a TBSS whose radial Doppler velocities are negative due to the falling hydrometeors. The second case is a less frequent event; there the Doppler velocities in the TBSS region are positive due to the updraft. The third case has both positive and negative values in the TBSS region; it ocurred in a supercell that affected the city of Varna in Bulgaria with large hail. The positive values were associated with the overhang region in the rotational updraft at upper heights, while the negative values in the regions outside the rotational updraft at lower heights, were associated with the downdrafts. Features produced by the TBSS have perturbed the output of the MESO and TVS algorithms by introducing false strong values of wind shear that have been interpreted as rotation. Thus false mesocyclonic and tornadic vortex signatures were generated. In some of the cases large hail and weak tornadoes were reported, so the presence of a TBSS was a challenge for the nowcasters. In the last part of the paper we analyze the link between the TBSS appearance with reports of large hail at the ground in 2009 within the coverage area of the Romanian S-band radars, which also cover parts of Hungary, Bulgaria, the Republic of Moldova and Serbia. The results show that the TBSS artifact is a strong indicator of large-size hail.},

In this paper we practice a statistical approach for evaluation and correction of “site error” for DF/TOA type LLN based on its lightning data. By comparing lightning locations recorded by at least 4 sensors between DF and TOA techniques, the spatial characteristics of “site error” for each sensor in the network can be obtained. The obtained “site error” then can be used to improve the accuracy of lightning locations especially those recorded by only 2 sensors. With this approach, the “site error” patterns for 23 sensors in Yunnan LLN are obtained. The features of these site error patterns are in good consistency with those in literature. Significant differences in lightning locations before and after “site error” corrections indicate that the proposed approach works effectively.},

abstract = {KNOWLEDGE of the kinematic structure of storms is important for understanding the internal physical processes. Radar has long provided information on the three-dimensional structure of storms from measurements of the radar reflectivity factor alone. Early users of radar gave total storm movement only, whereas later radar data were used to reveal internal motions based on information related to cloud physics such as the three-dimensional morphology of the storm volume. Such approaches have continued by using the increasingly finer scale details provided by more modern radar systems. Both Barge and Bergwall and Browning and Foote have used fine scale reflectivity structure to determine airflow in hailstorms. Doppler radar added a new dimension to our capabilities through its ability to measure directly the radial component of motion of an ensemble of hydrometeor particles. Two or three Doppler radars collecting data in conjunction, the equation of mass continuity, and an empirical radar reflectivity�terminal velocity relationship have enabled the estimation of the full three-dimensional airflow fields in parts of storms. Because of the inherent advantage of Doppler radar in motion detection, little effort has been directed toward developing objective schemes of determining internal storm motions with conventional meteorological radars. Pattern recognition schemes using correlation coefficient techniques, Fourier analysis, and gaussian curve fitting have been used with radar and satellite data, but primarily for detecting overall storm motions, echo merging and echo splitting. Here we describe an objective use of radar reflectivity factor data from a single conventional weather radar to give information related to the three-dimensional motions within a storm.},

abstract = {AbstractA high-precipitation tornadic supercell storm was observed on 29?30 May 2004 during the Thunderstorm Electrification and Lightning Experiment. Observational systems included the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array, mobile balloon-borne soundings, and two mobile C-band radars. The spatial distribution and evolution of lightning are related to storm kinematics and microphysics, specifically through regions of microphysical charging and the location and geometry of those charge regions. Lightning flashes near the core of this storm were extraordinarily frequent, but tended to be of shorter duration and smaller horizontal extent than typical flashes elsewhere. This is hypothesized to be due to the charge being in many small pockets, with opposite polarities of charge close together in adjoining pockets. Thus, each polarity of lightning leader could propagate only a relatively short distance before reaching regions of unfavorable electric potential. In the anvil, however, lightning extended tens of kilometers from the reflectivity cores in roughly horizontal layers, consistent with the charge spreading through the anvil in broad sheets. The strong, consistent updraft of this high-precipitation supercell storm combined with the large hydrometeor concentrations to produce the extremely high flash rates observed during the analysis period. The strength and size of the updraft also contributed to unique lightning characteristics such as the transient hole of reduced lightning density and discharges in the overshooting top.},

abstract = {This article on the epistemology of computational models stems from an analysis of the Ga{\"{i}}a hypothesis (GH). It begins with James Kirchner's criticisms of the central computational model of GH: Daisyworld. Among other things, the model has been criticized for being too abstract, describing fictional entities (fictive daisies on an imaginary planet) and trying to answer counterfactual (what-if) questions (how would a planet look like if life had no influence on it?). For these reasons the model has been considered not testable and therefore not legitimate in science, and in any case not very interesting since it explores non actual issues. This criticism implicitly assumes that science should only be involved in the making of models that are "actual" (by opposition to what-if) and "specific" (by opposition to abstract). I challenge both of these criticisms in this article. First by showing that although the testability - understood as the comparison of model output with empirical data - is an important procedure for explanatory models, there are plenty of models that are not testable. The fact that these are not testable (in this restricted sense) has nothing to do with their being "abstract" or "what-if" but with their being predictive models. Secondly, I argue that "abstract" and "what-if" models aim at (respectable) epistemic purposes distinct from those pursued by "actual and specific models". Abstract models are used to propose how-possibly explanation or to pursue theorizing. What-if models are used to attribute causal or explanatory power to a variable of interest. The fact that they aim at different epistemic goals entails that it may not be accurate to consider the choice between different kinds of model as a "strategy". {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2014.},

abstract = {Doppler weather radar data from the Joint Airport Weather Studies (JAWS) Project are used to determine the horizontal and vertical structure of airflow within microbursts. Typically, the associated downdraft is about 1 km wide and begins to spread horizontally at a height below 1 km. The median time from initial divergence at the surface to maximum differential wind velocity across the microburst is 5 min. The height of maximum differential velocity is ?75 m. The median velocity differential is 22 m s?1 over an average distance of 3.1 km. The outflow is asymmetric, averaging twice as strong along the maximum shear axis compared to the minimum axis. Doppler radar could be an effective means for identifying microbursts and warning aircraft of wind shear hazards. For microburst detection such a radar must be able to measure wind velocities in clear air as well as in heavy rain and hail. Scan update rates should be approximately every 2 min and the lowest few hundred meters of the atmosphere must be observed. Ground clutter must be considerably reduced from levels typically obtained with present Doppler radars. New antenna technology and signal processing techniques may solve this problem. Automated range and velocity unfolding is required, as well as automated identification and dissemination techniques.},

abstract = {Hailstone size distribution has been an integral part of hailfall measurement in several research projects. The exponential distribution is usually assumed to be an adequate representation of hailstone size spectra. This paper presents the results of the fitting to the exponential distribution of databases obtained from several hailpad networks set up in southern France (3 networks with 1,081 hailpads), Spain (2 networks with 269 hailpads), and Argentina (3 networks with 567 hailpads). These networks use the same type of plate, method of calibration, and semi-automatic measurement procedure. Results show that the characteristic parameters of the fittings are different in each area, even in areas that lie geographically quite close to each other. The values of the slopes obtained in the French networks are higher than the ones found in Spain and Argentina. Statistical techniques were applied to detect "breakpoints" in the hail size distribution, using piece-wise regression models (or "broken-stick" models). These points were used to estimate critical thresholds associated with transitions between two hailstone size distributions. In 4 networks in Spain and Argentina, breakpoints appear in large hail. The results show that, in 2 of the networks, the distribution is exponential (statistically significant) again from the breakpoint on. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sensitivity of 5-cm-wavelength polarimetric radar measurements to raindrop size and distribution is investigated. At this wavelength, resonance occurs for sizes larger than about 5 mm, and therefore several polarimetric variables exhibit nonmonotone dependence on the drop diameter. The resonance effect is examined for temperatures of 0?, 10?, 20?, and 30?C. Through use of truncated gamma distributions (parameterized as a function of rain rate from the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment), and truncated Marshall?Palmer distributions, the influence of the upper tail of the drop size distribution is brought out. This poorly documented region of sizes can have a significant effect on some polarimetric variables. These simulations are extended further to include estimates of rain rate from the reflectivity factor, the specific differential phase, the combined use of the specific differential phase and differential reflectivity, and the combined use of the reflectivity factor and differential reflectivity.},

abstract = {AbstractThe effects of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations are found to strongly affect the microphysical and electrical evolution of a numerically simulated small multicell storm. The simulations reproduce the well-known effects of updraft invigoration and delay of precipitation formation as increasing CCN from low to intermediate concentrations causes droplet sizes to decrease. Peak updrafts increased from 16 m s?1 at the lowest CCN to a maximum of 21?22 m s?1 at moderate CCN, where condensation latent heating is maximized. The transition from low to high CCN first maximizes warm-rain production before switching over to the ice process as the dominant precipitation mechanism. Average graupel density stays fairly high and constant at lower CCN, but then drops monotonically at higher CCN concentration, although high CCN also foster the appearance of small regions of larger, high-density graupel with high simulated radar reflectivity.Graupel production increases monotonically as CCN concentration rises from 50 to about 2000 cm?3. The lightning response is relatively weak until the Hallett?Mossop rime-splintering ice multiplication becomes more active at CCN > 700 cm?3. At very high CCN concentrations (>2000 cm?3), graupel production decreases slowly, but lightning activity drops dramatically when the parameterization of Hallett?Mossop rime-splintering ice multiplication is based on the number of large cloud droplets collected by graupel. Conversely, lightning activity remains steady at extremely high CCN concentration when the Hallett?Mossop parameterization is based simply on the rate of rime mass accumulation. The results lend support to the aerosol hypothesis as applied to lightning production, whereby greater CCN concentration tends to lead to greater lightning activity, but with a large sensitivity to ice multiplication.},

Focusing on the Amazon dry season, where thousands of manmade forest fires inject smoke into the atmosphere, we studied the aerosol effects on thunderclouds. We used the groundbased WorldWide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) lightning measurements together with Aqua MODIS aerosol and cloud data to show evidence for the transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds. The first is the microphysical effect which is manifested in an increase in convective intensity (and electrical activity), followed by the radiative effect that becomes dominant with the increase in aerosol loading leading to a decrease in convective intensity.},

The synoptic-scale structure contains information that can be utilized to discriminate between the two types of severe weather outbreaks through statistical methods. The Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) is initialized with synoptic-scale input data (the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset) on a set of 50 significant tornado outbreaks and 50 nontornadic severe weather outbreaks.

A number of distinct hypotheses have been proposed, spanning a range from the self-evident to the highly speculative. The self-evident forms of Gaia reiterate the well-documented fact that biological processes are critical to biogeochemical cycles, adding the straightforward (though important) point that the coupling between biotic and physical processes should create feedback loops. The speculative forms of Gaia assert that biological processes regulate the physical environment, keeping Earth's climate and surface geochemistry stable and favorable for life. As metaphors, these versions of Gaia are intriguing, untestable, and, if taken literally as a basis for research, potentially misleading.

abstract = {Nowcasting tools using radar data are essential when researching severe weather phenomena. Identifying thunderstorms and characterising their properties are usually the main steps to follow in order to make a good short-term forecast. These analyses are normally used to feed early warning systems in many countries, helping to reduce the impact of severe weather. Over the last few decades, research in this meteorological field has increased significantly, defining different methodologies that have worked well for many severe events. Most of these methodologies are based on a prior 3D identification of the thunderstorms in question, by applying intensity and size thresholds and obtaining their characteristics, allowing their centroids to be tracked. In some cases, the thresholds for identification and the distance established to track the centroid are too restrictive, which results in the incorrect identification of individual cells in multicell systems, or even means that the algorithm is unable to distinguish when an anomalous movement takes place. This paper presents a new type of 3D cell identification and tracking, based on the algorithm developed by Rigo and Llasat (2004). This last algorithm is currently used in the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC), and consists of a nowcasting methodology based on centroid tracking. In the new version, a new two-step methodology to construct 3D radar cells has been proposed. A double reflectivity thresholding method plus an overlapping technique have been applied for a better definition of the convective structures. This makes it possible to identify possible changing processes such as splitting or merging within the same thunderstorm. Furthermore, a dynamic distance threshold technique has been adopted to correctly track cells with anomalous movements. An in-depth study has been carried out for a severe weather case in which a multicell system presented a complex merging and splitting process that was correctly forecasted using the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Hail processes in deep convection can have a substantial impact on precipitation characteristics as well as on dynamic and thermodynamic properties of convective downdrafts and cold pools, yet the realistic representation of hail in many cloud-resolving models employing bulk microphysical schemes is challenging. The limits imposed by fixing one or two of the distribution parameters in many one- and two-moment bulk microphysics schemes often lead to particularly poor representations of particles within the tails of size distribution spectra; an especially important consideration for hail, which covers a broad range of sizes in nature. In order to improve the representation of hail distributions in simulations of deep moist convection in cloud-resolving numerical models, a new triple-moment bulk hail microphysics scheme (3MHAIL) is presented and evaluated. The 3MHAIL scheme predicts the relative dispersion parameter for a gamma distribution function via prognostication of the sixth moment (related to the reflectivity factor) of the distribution in addition to the mass mixing ratio and number concentration (third and zeroeth moments, respectively) thereby allowing for a fully prognostic distribution function. Significant improvement in the representation of sedimentation, melting, and formation processes of hail are achieved with the 3MHAIL scheme compared to lower-order moment schemes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the association between the extratropical Southern Hemisphere and the decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean (PO). We discuss a pattern of coherent large-scale anomalies and trends in cyclone and anticyclone behaviour in light of the climate variability in the PO over the ERA40 reanalysis period (1957-2002). The two representative PO indices are the Pacific Decadal and Interdecadal Oscillations (PDO and IPO), and here the PDO is chosen owing to it being less associated with the southern oscillation index (SOI). Composites of the indicators of the density and intensity of cyclones/ anticyclones given by an automatic tracking scheme were calculated for the years when the PDOI was more than one standard deviation above or below its mean. Although the ERA40 is not free from noise and assimilation changes, the results show a large-scale feature, which seems to be robust and agrees with earlier studies using different data sets. The sea-level pressure shows a strong annular structure related to the PDO, which is not seen for the SOI, with lower pressure around Antarctica during the positive phase and vice versa. More intense (and fewer) cyclones and anticyclones were observed during the positive PDO. This is less consistent for the SOI, particularly during the summer when a different PDO/SOI pattern arises at high latitudes. The trends project a pattern coincident with the positive PDO phase and seem to be linked with the main climate shift in the late seventies. Trends observed over the Tasman Sea are consistent with declining winter rainfall over southeastern Australia. Most patterns are statistically significant and seem robust, but random changes in ENSO may play a part, to a certain degree, in modulating the results, and a physical mechanism of causality has not been demonstrated. Although global warming and related changes in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) may also help explain the observed behaviour, the large-scale response presented here provides a new insight and would be of considerable interest for further modelling studies.

This study examines the spatial and temporal characteristics of severe thunderstorm life cycles in central United States mainly covering Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas during the warm seasons from 2010 to 2014. Thunderstorms are identified using radar reflectivity and cloud-to-ground lightning data and are tracked using a directed graph model that can represent the whole life cycle of a thunderstorm. Thunderstorms were stored in a GIS database with a number of additional thunderstorm attributes. Spatial and temporal characteristics of the thunderstorms were analyzed, including the yearly total number of thunderstorms, their monthly distribution, durations, initiation time, termination time, movement speed and direction, and the spatial distributions of thunderstorm tracks, initiations, and terminations. Results revealed that thunderstorms were most frequent across the eastern part of the study area, especially at the borders between Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Finally, thunderstorm occurrence is linked to land cover, including a comparison of thunderstorms between urban and surrounding rural areas. Results demonstrated that thunderstorms would favor forests and urban areas. This study demonstrates that advanced GIS representations and analyses for spatiotemporal events provide effective research tools to meteorological studies.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the important goals of NASA's Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers–Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) was to further the understanding of the evolution of tropical anvil clouds generated by deep convective systems. An important step toward understanding the radiative properties of convectively generated anvil clouds is to study their life cycle. Observations from ground-based radar, geostationary satellite radiometers, aircraft, and radiosondes during CRYSTAL-FACE provided a comprehensive look at the generation of anvil clouds by convective systems over South Florida during July 2002. This study focused on the relationship between convective rainfall and the evolution of the anvil cloud shield associated with convective systems over South Florida on 23 July 2002, during the CRYSTAL-FACE experiment. Anvil clouds emanating from convective cells grew downwind (to the southwest), reaching their maximum area at all temperature thresholds 1–2 h after the active c...},

abstract = {⎯ Bulgaria is situated in a geographical area with high frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and hail events. Like in many other countries, an upward trend of weather-induced damage has been observed during the last 15 years in Bulgaria. Much of it was caused by extreme weather events such as torrential precipitation associated with severe thunderstorms or/and wind storms. The series of flash floods and extreme hail storms, which hit Bulgaria in the warm half of 2014, were in line with that trend. On July 8, 2014, three supercell storms developed over West Bulgaria and heavily impacted urban areas in the afternoon. The extremely strong hail storms over Sofia and Montana were accompanied by strong wind gusts (about 85 km h –1) and torrential rain. The giant hail stones in Sofia had diameter of up to 10 cm and irregular shape. The severe hail and rain, and very strong wind caused substantial damage to infrastructure, buildings, vehicles, and agriculture. More than 40 people were injured by hail stones or collaterally by broken windows. One man was killed by a fallen tree. In Sofia alone, the reported damage was worth more than 100 million euro according to data from insurance companies. The paper presents the analysis of the evolution of the convective clouds based on radar data. The Doppler radar data revealed the existence of a mesocyclone, mesoanticyclone, microburst, and three-body scatter signature. The cloud top reached up to 17 km, and the maximum radar reflectivity factor was 69–71 dBZ. Analysis of the available radiosounding data, simulation with a numerical model, and the synoptic patterns are also presented.},

abstract = {A case study of convective development in the Southwest Amazon region during the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)/Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) Experiment in Amazonia is presented. The convective development during 7 February 1999 is shown to occur during a period of very weak large-scale forcing in the presence of topography and deforestation. The available data include dual Doppler radar analysis, radiosonde launches, and surface and boundary layer observations. The observational analysis is complemented with a series of model simulations using the RAMS with 2-km resolution over a 300 km 300 km area forced by a morning radiosonde profile. A comparison of the observed and simulated thermodynamic transformation of the boundary layer and of the formation of convective lines, and of their kinematic and microphysical properties is presented. It is shown that only a few very deep and intense convective cells are necessary to explain the overall precipitating line formation and that discrete propagation and coupling with upper atmosphere circulations may explain the appearance of several lines. The numerical simulation indicates that topography may be the cause of initial convective development, although later on the convective line is parallel to the midlevel shear. There are indications that small-scale deforestation may have an effect on increasing rainfall in the wet season when the large-scale forcing is very weak.},

abstract = {Line-normal, vertical cross sections of Houston Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) VHF radiation sources and radar reflectivity provide new insights into the three-dimensional total lightning structure and evolution of a leading-line, trailing-stratiform (LLTS) mesoscale convective system (MCS) over Houston, Texas, on 31 October 2005. Previous research examining only the mature stage of an MCS showed that the overwhelming majority of VHF lightning sources occurred in the convective region with a lightning pathway extending rearward and descending in altitude into the stratiform region. This descending pathway was most likely associated with small, charged ice particles advected from the convective line. Unlike previous research, the lightning pathway observed during the evolution of the MCS on 31 October 2005 initially extended rearward 40 km at a nearly constant height of 9–10 km. In less than an hour, the lightning pathway evolved into a sloped pathway, similar to that found by previous research, with a horizontal extent between 50 to 60 km and downward descent of 4 to 5 km. During the lightning pathway evolution, radar analysis showed an increase of reflectivity in the midlevels of the stratiform region, consistent with increased depositional and aggregational growth above the melting layer. Broadening (increased range of values) of radar reflectivity above the melting layer was most likely an indication of a strengthening mesoscale updraft in the stratiform region. This strengthening updraft may have contributed to an increase in the growth of the small, charge carrying ice crystals giving them a greater fall speed. In addition, the mesoscale updraft may have promoted an environment conducive to local stratiform region charge generation in the mixed phase region just above the melting layer.},

abstract = {The Aurora, Nebraska, hailstorm of 22 June 2003 produced some exceptionally large hailstones, and was widely publicized. Nineteen hailstones obtained from local people have been sectioned and photographed and eight are illustrated here, recording their interior layering and external appearance. They exhibit great variability, with features that are common to large hail as well as one unusual growth form: a roughly prolate external shape indicating an approximately constant falling orientation during final growth, forming large, icicle-like projections at one end. Much of the growth is wet but not appreciably spongy, as appears to be common for large hail. While a hailstone from this storm has been called the largest recorded in the United States on the basis of its longest dimension, we suggest that the most meaningful measure of hailstone size is weight. Weight is unambiguous and easily measured, and is an excellent indicator of volume for large hail. People generally think of hail as spherical and large hail but is often far from that shape; the terms “diameter” and “circumference” are therefore inappropriate, and if records of linear dimensions are to be kept, they probably should be termed “maximum length” and “maximum perimeter.”},

abstract = {Ten years (1997-2006) of summer (June-August) daytime (1400-0000 UTC) Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler data for Houston, Texas, were examined to determine the best radar-derived predictors of the first cloud-to-ground lightning flash from a convective cell. Convective cells were tracked using a modified version of the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking (SCIT) algorithm and then correlated to cloud-toground lightning data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Combinations of three radar reflectivity values (30, 35, and 40 dBZ) at four isothermal levels (-10°, -15°, -20°, and updraft -10°C) and a new radar-derived product, vertically integrated ice (VII), were used to optimize a radar-based lightning forecast algorithm. Forecasts were also delineated by range and the number of times a cell was identified and tracked by the modified SCIT algorithm. This study objectively analyzed 67 384 unique cells and 1 028 510 lightning flashes to find the best lightning forecast criteria. Results show that using 30 dBZ at the -15° or -20°C isotherm on cells within 75 km of the radar that have been tracked for at least two consecutive scans produces the best lightning forecasts with a critical success index (CSI) of 0.68. The best VII predictor values were 0.42 or 0.58 kg m -2 on cells within 75 km of the radar that have been tracked for at least two consecutive scans, producing a CSI of 0.67. Lead times for these predictors were 10.0 and 13.4 min, respectively. Lead times greater than 10 min occurred with less stringent predictors (e.g., 30 dBZ at -10°C or VII greater than 0.25 kg m -2 on cells within 125 km with a minimum track count of 2), but lower CSI values result. In general, cells tracked for multiple scans provide higher CSIs and lead times than decreasing the range from the radar or changing the reflectivity threshold and height. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

We compare the substorm point discharge current, intracloud (IC) lightning flash rate, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash rate, ground strike location, and flash polarity to the progression of precipitation types and amounts. This study is unique in that it presents multiparameter radar observations of a thunderstorm complex which exhibited an extremely high IC-to-CG ratio (IC/CG, 20-70) and predominantly positive CG lightning (over 74%) after it became severe, producing large hail and weak tornadoes. In particular, we investigate the reported relationship between large hail and positive CG lightning. Although a direct correlation is found between a rapid increase in IC/CG, the first positive CG lightning flashes, and the initial production of hail aloft, the temporal and spatial behavior of large hail and positive CG lightning appear to be anticorrelated, as broad peaks in the positive CG flash rate lag relative maxima in the fallout of large hail by up to 30 min. The majority of positive ground strikes were adjacent to the main precipitation core in a region of light rain and little or no hail at the surface. Aloft, radar data indicated that ice crystals were aligned vertically in a strong electric field. Corona point observations at the surface indicate that these regions adjacent to the convective core were characterized by net positive charge aloft. Possible mechanisms to explain these observations are discussed.},

The developed techniques show considerable skill at estimating the maximum hailstone size produced by a thunderstorm, with the correlation coefficients between the parameters used and maximum hailstone size being as high as 0.89. The data also show that estimates of maximum hailstone size have an 80% chance of being accurate to within ±1.4 cm. The developed techniques are computationally simple and should be useful for real-time estimation of the maximum hailstone size likely to be produced by a thunderstorm.},

Data from weather stations of the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS) indicated a mean yearly point frequency varying between 1 and 2 hail days for Central Macedonia. Crop insurance data from the Hellenic National Agricultural Insurance Organization (ELGA) showed a mean regional frequency of 22.3 hail days for the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, about 6,500 km2, for the warm season, from April to September. Hailpad data representing almost one third of the total cultivated area of Central Macedonia, indicated a regional average of 8 hail days and 45 hailpads recording hail for the warm season. Spatial analysis over the hailpad area revealed a large variability of hail occurrence, with local maxima at the higher altitude and close to mountain barrier areas and a decreasing frequency over areas closer to the sea. The size distribution of a sample of 22,000 hailstones measured by the hailpads, showed a great majority, of 85.7%, having diameters up to 11 mm. An inter-comparison of hail impact energies according to crop damaging potential indicated Central Macedonia hailfalls as the less intense compared to those of areas of Northern America. Application of the revised TORRO hail intensity scale extending to classes from H0 to H10, permitted a classification of Central Macedonia hailfalls appropriate for comparisons and correspondence between areas and countries about the severity and damaging of hailfalls. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Examples of automatic interpretation of polarimetric measurements made with an algorithm that classifies precipitation, from an Oklahoma squall line and a Florida airmass storm are presented. Developed in this paper are sensitivity tests of this algorithm to various polarimetric variables. The tests are done subjectively by comparing the fields of hydrometeors obtained using the full set of available polarimetric variables with a diminished set whereby some variables have been left out. An objective way to test the sensitivity of the algorithm to variables and rank their utility is also devised. The test involves definition of a measure, which is the number of data points classified into a category using subsets of available variables. Ratios of various measures (similar to probabilities) define the percentage of occurrence of a class. By comparing these percentages for cases in which some variables are excluded to those whereby all are included, a relative merit can be assigned to the variables. Results of this objective sensitivity study reveal the following: the reflectivity factor and differential reflectivity combined have the strongest discriminating power. Inclusion of the temperature profile helps eliminate a substantial number of spurious errors. Although the absence of temperature information degrades the scheme, it appears that the resultant fields are generally coherent and not far off from the fields obtained by adding temperature to the suite of polarimetric variables.},

abstract = {Abstract A primary goal of the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (SCSMEX), a major field campaign of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), is to define the initiation, structure, evolution, and dynamics of precipitation processes associated with the onset of the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon. In this study, dual-Doppler and dual-polarimetric radar analysis techniques are used to investigate the development and structure of a squall-line system observed on 24 May 1998. The focus is the linkage between the airflow and the microphysical fields through the system. The squall-line system, including three distinct lines, persisted from 1200 UTC 24 May to the following day. A detailed study was performed on the structure of the second and most intense line, lasting for over 10 h. Compared to tropical squall lines observed in other regions, this narrow squall-line system had some interesting features including 1) maximum reflectivity as high as 55 dBZ; 2) relatively little stratiform rainfall th...},

abstract = {Polarimetric radar measurements made by the recently upgraded CSU-CHILL radar system in a severe hailstorm are analyzed permitting for the first time the combined use of Z h , Z DR , linear depolarization ratio (LDR), K DP , and $\rho$ hv to infer hydrometeor types. A chase van equipped for manual collection of hail, and instrumented with a rain gauge, intercepted the storm core for 50 min. The period of golfball-sized hail is easily distinguished by high LDR (greater than or equal to -18 dB), negative Z DR (less than or equal to -0.5 dB), and low $\rho$ hv (less than or equal to 0.93) values near the surface. Rainfall accumulation over the entire event (about 40 mm estimated using K DP is in excellent agreement with the rain gauge measurement. Limited dual-Doppler synthesis using the CSU-CHILL and Denver WSR-88D radars permit estimates of the horizontal convergence at altitudes less than 3 km above ground level (AGL) at 1747 and 1812 mountain daylight time (MDT). Locations of peak horizontal convergence at these times are centered on well-defined positive Z DR columns. Vertical sections of multiparameter radar data at 1812 MDT are interpreted in terms of hydrometeor type. In particular, an enhanced LDR "cap" area on top of the the positive Z DR column is interpreted as a region of mixed phase with large drops mixed with partially frozen and frozen hydrometeors. A positive K DP column on the the western fringe of the main updraft is inferred to be the result of drops (1-2 mm) shed by wet hailstones. Swaths of large hail at the surface (inferred from LDR signatures) and positive Z DR at 3.5 km AGL suggest that potential frozen drop embryos are favorably located for growth into large hailstones. Thin section analysis of a sample of the large hailstones shows that 30%-40% have frozen drop embryos.},

This study utilized multiple dual-polarization Doppler radars across northern Alabama to quantify microphysical and kinematic properties and processes that often serve as precursors to lightning, such as the graupel echo volume, graupel mass, and convective updraft volume. The focus here was on one multicellular complex that occurred on 21 May 2012 in northern Alabama during DC3. The graupel echo volume and the graupel mass in the charging region correlated well with the total lightning flash rate (FR), and even better than the updraft volumes and maximum updraft velocities. The flash length scales (LS) and flash areas were generally anticorrelated to the FR, while it was correlated to the nonprecipitation ice volume. More specifically, the presence of smaller flashes was associated with a stronger lower positive charge region caused by larger graupel volumes, stronger updraft volumes, and stronger maximum updraft velocities while larger flashes occurred during lower FRs and were associated with a weakened lower positive charge region in combination with a stronger upper positive charge region, weaker updraft velocities, a smaller graupel volume and mass, and an increase in nonprecipitation ice volume.},

Bow echo patterns in radar images are associated with a number of these destructive conditions such as damaging winds, hail, thunderstorms, and tornadoes. They are detected manually by meteorologists. In this paper, we propose an automatic framework to detect these patterns with high accuracy by introducing novel skeletonization and shape matching approaches. In this framework, first we extract regions with high probability of occurring bow echo from radar images and apply our skeletonization method to extract the skeleton of those regions. Next, we prune these skeletons using our innovative pruning scheme with fuzzy logic. Then, using our proposed shape descriptor, Skeleton Context, we can extract bow echo features from these skeletons in order to use them in shape matching algorithm and classification step. The output of classification indicates whether these regions are bow echo with over 97% accuracy.},

abstract = {Organisms can greatly affect their environments, and the feedback coupling between organisms and their environments can shape the evolution of both. Beyond these generally accepted facts, the Gaia hypothesis advances three central propositions: (1) that biologically mediated feedbacks contribute to environmental homeostasis, (2) that they make the environment more suitable for life, and (3) that such feedbacks should arise by Darwinian natural selection. These three propositions do not fare well under close scrutiny. (1) Biologically mediated feedbacks are not intrinsically homeostatic. Many of the biological mechanisms that affect global climate are destabilizing, and it is likely that the net effect of biological feedbacks will be to amplify, not dampen, global warming. (2) Nor do biologically mediated feedbacks necessarily enhance the environment, although it will often appear as if this were the case, simply because natural selection will favor organisms that do well in their environments – which means doing wellunder the conditions that they and their co-occurring species have created. (3) Finally, Gaian feedbacks can evolve by natural selection, but so can anti-Gaian feedbacks. Daisyworld models evolve Gaian feedback because they assume that any trait that improves the environment will also give a reproductive advantage to its carriers (over other organisms that share the same environment). In the real world, by contrast, natural selection favors any trait that gives its carriers a reproductive advantage over its non-carriers, whether it improves or degrades the environment (and thereby benefits or hinders its carriers and non-carriers alike). Thus Gaian and anti-Gaian feedbacks are both likely to evolve.},

In this study, a 12-year statistic of objectively identified cold fronts and a radar-based hail statistic are combined to investigate the co-occurrence of cold fronts and hail in Switzerland. In a first step, an automated front identification scheme, which has previously been designed for and applied to global reanalysis data, is modified for a high-resolution regional analysis data set. This front detection method is then adapted, tested and applied to the Consortium for Small Scale Modelling (COSMO) analysis data for the extended hail season (May to September) in the years 2002-2013. The resulting cold front statistic is presented and discussed. In a second step, the frequency of cold fronts is linked to a high-resolution radar-based hail statistic to determine the relative fraction of hail initiation events in pre-frontal environments. Up to 45% of all detected hail events in north-eastern and southern Switzerland form in pre-frontal zones. Similar fractions are identified upstream of the Jura and the Black Forest mountains. The percentage of front-related hail formation is highest in regions where hail is statistically less frequent, with the exception of southern Switzerland. Furthermore, it is shown that fronts create wind-sheared environments, which are favourable for hail cells.},

We examine trends via the Mann-Kendall test and periodicities by wavelet analysis. The results show cluster classification of precipitation to be somewhat consistent with hailpad networks in the study area. In the Pyrenees, there was a non-significant negative trend of precipitation and a substantial increase of hail days and intensity of hail, which were close to the limit of significance. Finally, a wavelet coherence analysis shows a strong influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Atlantic region.},

@article{Palencia2007,
abstract = {This paper is a comparative study between the two most common hailpad calibration systems: one annual calibration of a whole consignment of material, and the individual calibration of each plate after a hailfall. Individual calibration attempts to minimize errors due to differences in sensitivity to the impact of hailstones between plates from the same consignment, or due to differences in the inking process before the actual measurement. The comparison was carried out using calibration data from the past few years in the hailpad network in south-western France, and data from an individual calibration process on material provided by the hailpad network in Lleida (Spain). The same type of material was used in the two cases. The results confirm that the error in measuring hailstone sizes is smaller in the case of an individual calibration of hailpads than when one single calibration process was carried out for a whole consignment. The former is approximately 80% of the latter. However, this error could have been higher if it had not been the same person carrying out the single calibration process and the measuring of the dents: it has been found that differences in the inking process may account for up to 20% of the error in the case of small hailstones. Calibration errors affecting other variables, e.g. energy or parameter $\lambda$ of the exponential size distribution are generally higher (5% and 18%, respectively) than errors due to the spatial variability of the hailstones. However, the calibration method does not influence the maximum size, since the relative error attributed to the spatial variability is about 8 times the calibration error. In conclusion, if errors in determining energy or parameter $\lambda$ are to be reduced to a minimum, it is highly advisable to be consistent in applying the measuring procedure (if possible with the same person carrying out the measurements all the time), and even to use individual calibration on each plate, always bearing in mind that technicians have to be trained appropriately in order to achieve the highest possible degree of uniformity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The research aircraft sampled growing convective clouds over the ocean and over land. High concentrations of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were observed over land compared to ocean. Over ocean, higher liquid water content (LWC) and lower cloud droplet number concentrations (Nc) were observed, and droplets reached the threshold of precipitation initiation at lower cloud depths. Over land, clouds contained lower LWC and higher Nc, hence droplets did not reach the threshold of precipitation initiation at a warm temperature as in ocean clouds. Over the ocean larger droplets or drizzle were observed at lower cloud depth than over land. The maximum LWC was found to be very similar at higher altitudes. The convective clouds over land were modified by pollution aerosol with contrasting microphysical properties to those over the ocean.},

abstract = {The recognition that the aerosol particle size distribution (PSD) is effectively bimodal permits the extraction of the fine and coarse mode optical depths ($\tau$f and $\tau$c) from the spectral shape of the total aerosol optical depth ($\tau$a = $\tau$f + $\tau$c). This purely optical technique avoids intermediate computations of the PSD and yields a direct optical output that is commensurate in complexity with the spectral information content of $\tau$a. The separation into $\tau$f and $\tau$c is a robust process and yields aerosol optical statistics, which are more intrinsic than those, obtained from a generic analysis of $\tau$a. Partial (optical) validation is provided by (1) demonstrating the physical coherence of the simple model employed, (2) demonstrating that $\tau$c variation is coherent with photographic evidence of thin cloud events and that $\tau$f variation is coherent with photographic evidence of clear sky and haze events, and (3) showing that the retrieved values of $\tau$f and $\tau$c are well-correlated, if weakly biased, relative to formal inversions of combined solar extinction and sky radiance data. The spectral inversion technique permitted a closer scrutiny of a standard (temporally based) cloud-screening algorithm. Perturbations of monthly or longer-term statistics associated with passive or active shortcomings of operational cloud screening were inferred to be small to occasionally moderate over a sampling of cases. Diurnal illustrations were given where it was clear that such shortcomings can have a significant impact on the interpretation of specific events; (1) commission errors in $\tau$f due to the exclusion of excessively high-frequency fine mode events and (2) omission errors in $\tau$c due to the inclusion of insufficiently high-frequency thin homogeneous cloud events.},

abstract = {During the period 1996–2000, forty-three heavy rainfall events have been detected in the Internal Basins of Catalonia (Northeastern of Spain). Most of these events caused floods and serious damage. This high number leads to the need for a methodology to classify them, on the basis of their surface rainfall distribution, their internal organization and their physical features. The aim of this paper is to showa methodology to analyze systematically the convective struc- tures responsible of those heavy rainfall events on the basis of the information supplied by the meteorological radar. The proposed methodology is as follows. Firstly, the rainfall in- tensity and the surface rainfall pattern are analyzed on the basis of the raingauge data. Secondly, the convective struc- tures at the lowest level are identified and characterized by using a 2-D algorithm, and the convective cells are identified by using a 3-D procedure that looks for the reflectivity cores in every radar volume. Thirdly, the convective cells (3-D) are associated with the 2-D structures (convective rainfall areas). This methodology has been applied to the 43 heavy rainfall events using the meteorological radar located near Barcelona and the SAIH automatic raingauge network.},

abstract = {A vertically inhomogeneous mid-latitude mixed-phase altocumulus cloud was observed around 17:26 UTC on Oct. 14, 2001 during the 9th Cloud Layer Experiment (CLEX9). In this study the microphysical and optical properties of this cloud are investigated on the basis of in-situ observed vertical profiles of particle size and habit distributions. Two cloud models, assuming that the cloud properties were vertically homogeneous and inhomogeneous, are adopted to derive the bulk optical and radiative properties of this cloud. The observed microphysical properties are combined with the theoretical solutions to the scattering and absorption properties of individual cloud particles to determine the bulk optical properties at various heights within the cloud layer. The single-scattering properties of spherical liquid water droplets and nonspherical ice crystals are obtained from the Lorenz-Mie theory and an existing database, respectively. The bulk microphysical and optical properties associated with the inhomogeneous model depend strongly on the height above the cloud-base whereas the dependence is smoothed out in the case of the homogeneous model. Furthermore, the transfer of infrared radiation is simulated in conjunction with the two cloud models. It is shown that the brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere in the case of the homogeneous model can be 1.5% (3.8 K) higher than their counterpart associated with the inhomogeneous cloud model. This result demonstrates that the effect of the vertical inhomogeneity of a mixed-phase cloud on its radiative properties is not negligible. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A retrieval method for deriving the hydrometeor mixing ratio within mesoscale convective system (MCS) is presented in this study. The hydrometeor retrieval method was designed to incorporate the flash extent densities (FED) data from the Feng-Yun-4 geostationary satellite into the S-band radar reflectivity (Zh) and ambient temperature (T) data-based hydrometeor retrieval method. Total lightning data are utilized to better discern regions containing graupel in clouds. In the quantitative estimation of rain mixing ratio, different intercept parameters are used for different ranges of Zh and different estimated precursors of raindrop in cold-cloud microphysical processes (i.e., graupel and snow aggregate). The hydrometeor retrieval method was evaluated through an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which the pseudo-input-data for the hydrometeor retrieval (i.e., the FED, Zh and T data) were obtained from the cloud-scale (1-km) simulation of an MCS using explicit electrification implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model. By incorporating the FED data as an additional input data source into the Zh and T-based hydrometeor retrieval method, the hydrometeor retrieval accuracy was improved. The hydrometeor retrievals were then assimilated into the model using the Real-Time Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (RTFDDA) system. Assimilating more accurate hydrometeor fields slightly improved the analyses and forecasts of convective precipitation in the test MCS case. The improvement could be due to the more accurate hydrometeor analysis, which further affected the strength of the cold pool and gust front.},

abstract = {A study was undertaken to examine growing cumulus clouds using 1-min time resolution Super Rapid Scan Operations for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) (SRSOR) imagery to diagnose in-cloud processes from cloud-top information. SRSOR data were collected using GOES-14 for events in 2012–14. Use of 1-min resolution SRSOR observations of rapidly changing scenes provides far more insights into cloud processes as compared to when present-day 5–15-min time resolution GOES data are used. For midday times on five days, cloud-top temperatures were cataloged for 71 cumulus clouds as they grew to possess anvils and often overshooting cloud tops, which occurred over 33–152-min time periods. Characteristics of the SRSOR-observed updrafts were examined individually, on a per day basis, and collectively, to reveal unique aspects of updraft behavior, strength, and acceleration as related to the ambient stability profile and cloud-top glaciation. A conclusion is that the 1-min observations capture two specific cumulus cloud growth periods, less rapid cloud growth between the level of free convection and the 0°C isotherm level, followed by more rapid growth shortly after the time of cloud-top glaciation. High correlation is found between estimated vertical motion (w) and the amount of convective available potential energy (CAPE) realized to the cloud-top level as clouds grew, which suggests that updrafts were responding to the local buoyancy quite strongly. Influences of the environmental buoyancy profile shape and evidence of entrainment on cloud growth are also found through these SRSOR data analyses.},

abstract = {The diurnal variation of the global electric circuit is investigated using the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), which has been shown to identify nearly all thunderstorms (using WWLLN data from 2005). To create an estimate of global electric circuit activity, a clustering algorithm is applied to the WWLLN data set to identify global thunderstorms from 2010 to 2013. Annual, seasonal, and regional thunderstorm activity is investigated in this new WWLLN thunderstorm data set in order to estimate the source behavior of the global electric circuit. Through the clustering algorithm, the total number of active thunderstorms are counted every 30 min creating a measure of the global electric circuit source function. The thunderstorm clusters are compared to precipitation radar data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellite and with case studies of thunderstorm evolution. The clustering algorithm reveals an average of 660±70 thunderstorms active at any given time with a peak-to-peak variation of 36%. The highest number of thunderstorms occurs in November (720±90), and the lowest number occurs in January (610±80). Thunderstorm cluster and electrified storm cloud activity are combined with thunderstorm overflight current measurements to estimate the global electric circuit thunderstorm contribution current to be 1090±70 A with a variation of 24%. By utilizing the global coverage and high time resolution of WWLLN, the total active thunderstorm count and current is shown to be less than previous estimates based on compiled climatologies.},

Objective automated algorithms for detectingwave breaking and determining the location, intensity, and direction of the jet are adopted. The analysis is performed on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis and the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM).We find that DWB events can project onto both phases of the NAO, albeit showing no strong preference for either. Wave-breaking pairs occurring in the northern North Atlantic project onto the positive NAO, while the opposite holds for pairs occurring farther south.DWB also affects the direction and intensity of the jet stream. Events in the eastern half of the basin (EWB) intensify and zonalize the jet, while events farther to the west (WWB) weaken the westerly flow over Europe. An analysis of destructive wind storms over Europe in the last three decades suggests that these are typically associated with a very intense, zonal jet—similar to the case of EWB. Indeed, EWB corresponds to an enhanced likelihood of destructive windstorms over the continent, although there is not a one-to-one correspondence. The MPI-ESMmodel does not capture this statistical relationship. On the contrary, WWB corresponds to a decreased likelihood of destructive weather.},

Storms defined in this way are identified at discrete time intervals. An optimization scheme is employed to match the storms at one time with those at the following time, with some geometric logic to deal with mergers and splits. The short-term forecast of both position and size is based on a weighted linear fit to the storm track history data.

abstract = {The three-body scatter signature (TBSS) is a radar artifact that appears downrange from a high-radar-reflectivity core in a thunderstorm as a result of the presence of hailstones. It is useful to identify the TBSS artifact for quality control of radar data used in numerical weather prediction and quantitative precipitation estimation. Therefore, it is advantageous to develop a method to automatically identify TBSS in radar data for the above applications and to help identify hailstones within thunderstorms. In this study, a fuzzy logic classification algorithm for TBSS identification is developed. Polarimetric radar data collected by the experimental S-band Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) in Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), are used to develop trapezoidal membership functions for the TBSS class of radar echo within a hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA). Nearly 3000 radar gates are removed from 50 TBSSs to develop the membership functions from the data statistics. Five variables are investigated for the discrimination of the radar echo: 1) horizontal radar reflectivity factor Z(H), 2) differential reflectivity Z(DR), 3) copolar cross-correlation coefficient rho(hv), 4) along-beam standard deviation of horizontal radar reflectivity factor SD(Z(H)), and 5) along-beam standard deviation of differential phase SD Phi(DP)). These membership functions are added to an HCA to identify TBSSs. Testing is conducted on radar data collected by dual-polarization-upgraded operational WSR-88Ds from multiple severe-weather events, and results show that automatic identification of the TBSS through the enhanced HCA is feasible for operational use.},

Office established a joint R&D programme with the Environment Agency (responsible for flood prediction in England and Wales) to explore the benefits of an Object-Oriented conceptual Model (OOM) of convection in the nowcasting of fluvial floods. This involved the development of an automated nowcasting system (GANDOLF) designed to run the OOM during episodes of dir mass convection. This paper describes the structure and function of the GANDOLF system and compares the performance of the OOM with that of two other precipitation models routinely used by Thames Region of the Agency.},

abstract = {The Angstrom wavelength exponent $\alpha$, which is the slope of the logarithm of aerosol optical depth ($\tau$a) versus the logarithm of wavelength ($\lambda$), is commonly used to characterize the wavelength dependence of $\tau$a and to provide some basic information on the aerosol size distribution. This parameter is frequently computed from the spectral measurements of both ground-based sunphotometers and from satellite and aircraft remote sensing retrievals. However, spectral variation of $\alpha$ is typically not considered in the analysis and comparison of values from different techniques. We analyze the spectral measurements of $\tau$a from 340 to 1020 nm obtained from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network radiometers located in various locations where either biomass burning, urban, or desert dust aerosols are prevalent. Aerosol size distribution retrievals obtained from combined solar extinction and sky radiance measurements are also utilized in the analysis. These data show that there is significant curvature in the ln $\tau$a versus ln $\lambda$ relationship for aerosol size distributions dominated by accumulation mode aerosols (biomass burning and urban). Mie theory calculations of $\alpha$ for biomass burning smoke (for a case of aged smoke at high optical depth) agree well with observations, confirming that large spectral variations in $\alpha$ are due to the dominance of accumulation mode aerosols. A second order polynomial fit to the ln $\tau$a versus ln $\lambda$ data provides excellent agreement with differences in $\tau$a of the order of the uncertainty in the measurements (∼0.01-0.02). The significant curvature in ln $\tau$a versus ln $\lambda$ for high optical depth accumulation mode dominated aerosols results in $\alpha$ values differing by a factor of 3–5 from 340 to 870 nm. We characterize the curvature in ln $\tau$a versus ln $\lambda$ by the second derivative $\alpha$′ and suggest that this parameter be utilized in conjunction with $\alpha$ to characterize the spectral dependence of $\tau$a. The second derivative of ln $\tau$a versus ln $\lambda$ gives an indication of the relative influence of accumulation mode versus coarse mode particles on optical properties.},

abstract = {In this study, it is hypothesized that the mesoscale environment can indirectly control the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning polarity of severe storms by directly affecting their structural, dynamical, and microphysical properties, which in turn directly control cloud electrification and ground flash polarity. A more specific hypothesis, which has been supported by past observational and laboratory charging studies, suggests that broad, strong updrafts and associated large liquid water contents in severe storms lead to the generation of an inverted charge structure and enhanced +CG lightning production. The corollary is that environmental conditions favoring these kinematic and microphysical characteristics should support severe storms gener- ating an anomalously high (>25%) percentage of+CG lightning (i.e., positive storms) while environmental conditions relatively less favorable should sustain storms characterized by a typical (<=25%) percentage of +CG lightning (i.e., negative storms). Forty-eight inflow proximity soundings were analyzed to characterize the environment of nine distinct mesoscale regions of severe storms (4 positive and 5 negative) on 6 days during May–June 2002 over the central United States. This analysis clearly demonstrated significant and systematic differences in the mesoscale environments of positive and negative storms, which were consistent with the stated hypothesis. When compared to negative storms, positive storms occurred in environments associated with a drier low to midtroposphere, higher cloud-base height, smaller warm cloud depth, stronger conditional instability, larger 0–3 km AGL wind shear, stronger 0–2 km AGL storm relative wind speed, and larger buoyancy in the mixed-phase zone, at a statistically significant level. Differences in the warm cloud depth of positive and negative storms were by far the most dramatic, suggesting an important role for this parameter in controlling CG lightning polarity. In this study, strong correlations between the mesoscale environment and CG lightning polarity were demonstrated. However, causality could not be verified due to a lack of in situ observations to confirm the hypothesized microphysical, dynamical, and electrical responses to variations in environmental conditions that ultimately determined the dominant CG polarity. Future observational field programs and cloud modeling studies should focus on these critical intermediary pro- cesses.},

The initiation, propagation direction, and termination of the discharge are computed using the magnitude and direction of the electric field vector as the determining criteria. The charge redistribution due to the lightning is approximated assuming the channel to be an isolated conductor with zero net charge over its entire length. Various simulations involving differing amounts of charge transferred and distribution of charges have been done. Values of charge transfer, dipole moment change, and electrical energy dissipation computed in the model are consistent with observations. The effects of the lightning-produced ions on the hydrometeor charges and electric field components depend strongly on the amount of charge transferred. A comparison between the measured electric field change of an actual intracloud flash and the field change due to the simulated discharge shows favorable agreement. Limitations of the parameterization scheme are discussed.},

abstract = {A new prognostic, spatially and temporally dependent variable is introduced to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). This variable is called the potential electrical energy (Ep). It was used to predict the dynamic contribution of the grid-scale-resolved microphysical and vertical velocity fields to the production of cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning in convection-allowing forecasts. The source of Ep is assumed to be the noninductive charge separation process involving collisions of graupel and ice particles in the presence of supercooled liquid water. The Ep dissipates when it exceeds preas- signed threshold values and lightning is generated. An analysis of four case studies is presented and analyzed. On the 4-km simulation grid, a single cloud-to-ground lightning event was forecast with about equal values of probability of detection (POD) and false alarmratio (FAR).However, when lighting was integrated onto 12-km and then 36-km grid overlays, there was a large improvement in the forecast skill, and as many as 10 cloud-to-ground lighting events were well forecast on the 36-km grid. The impact of initial conditions on forecast accuracy is briefly discussed, including an evaluation of the scheme in wintertime, when lightning activity is weaker. The dynamic algorithm forecasts are also contrasted with statistical lightning forecasts and differences are noted. The scheme is being used operationally with the Rapid Refresh (13 km) data; the skill scores in these operational runs were very good in clearly defined convective situations.},

In this article, it investigates changes in the lightning activity in the city of Manaus, located in the Amazon region of Brazil. It is found that, over the city, the lightning activity is larger than in the regions around it and it has been increasing in the last four decades simultaneously with the increasing of its urban area. Our results suggest that such changes are caused by the UHI effect. The observations reported here are unique and relevant because Manaus is located in the central part of the Amazon rainforest and inside one of the three global lightning chimneys in the world.},

abstract = {Polarimetric radar-based?hydrometeor classification is the procedure of identifying different types of hydrometeors by exploiting polarimetric radar observations. The main drawback of the existing supervised classification methods, mostly based on fuzzy logic, is a significant dependency on a presumed electromagnetic behaviour of different hydrometeor types. Namely, the results of the classification largely rely upon the quality of scattering simulations. When it comes to the unsupervised approach, it lacks the constraints related to the hydrometeor microphysics. The idea of the proposed method is to compensate for these drawbacks by combining the two approaches in a way that microphysical hypotheses can, to a degree, adjust the content of the classes obtained statistically from the observations. This is done by means of an iterative approach, performed offline, which, in a statistical framework, examines clustered representative polarimetric observations by comparing them to the presumed polarimetric properties of each hydrometeor class. Aside from comparing, a routine alters the content of clusters by encouraging further statistical clustering in case of non-identification. By merging all identified clusters, the multi-dimensional polarimetric signatures of various hydrometeor types are obtained for each of the studied representative datasets, i.e. for each radar system of interest. These are depicted by sets of centroids which are then employed in operational labelling of different hydrometeors. The method has been applied on three C-band datasets, each acquired by different operational radar from the MeteoSwiss Rad4Alp network, as well as on two X-band datasets acquired by two research mobile radars. The results are discussed through a comparative analysis which includes a corresponding supervised and unsupervised approach, emphasising the operational potential of the proposed method.},

This study synthesizes these recent results, and considers how variability in the non-inductive relative-growth rate electrification mechanism might clarifying the meaning of "inverted polarity". Instead of falling into two polarity classes, electrification and charge structure in strong updrafts vary continuously, as expected if depletion of supercooled water is a primary control on electrification. Two- or three-dimensional storm flows or other electrification mechanisms are required to combine one or more of these electrification regimes into "inverted" or otherwise complicated local charge sequences. Cloud flashes that result from these local charge sequences should be termed "positive" and "negative" instead of "normal" and "inverted" because cloud flashes of either polarity can occur at any altitude in thunderstorms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The previously studied 1998 case shows anomalously high frequencies of positive cloud-to-ground lightning (+CG%) in the southern Great Plains region of the USA, coincident with the smoke plume from forest fires in Central America. Fires in the northwestern USA in summer 2000 produced a smoke pall commensurate with the 1998 fires, but were not accompanied by statistically significant lightning anomalies. Analyses of meteorological data reveal that the southern Great Plains region was abnormally dry and hot during the period of anomalous lightning in 1998. Using a 1.5-dimensional thunderstorm model on a day with high +CG%, 15 May 1998, we find that whereas the percentage of positive cloud-to-ground lightning did not change significantly with changes in cloud condensation nuclei, adding moisture to the model significantly decreases the percentage of positive cloud-to-ground lightning, making it closer to the climatological norm.

abstract = {AbstractIce particle formation in tropospheric clouds significantly changes cloud radiative and microphysical properties. Ice nucleation in the troposphere via homogeneous freezing occurs at temperatures lower than −38°C and relative humidity with respect to ice above 140%. In the absence of these conditions, ice formation can proceed via heterogeneous nucleation aided by aerosol particles known as ice nucleating particles (INPs). In this chapter, new developments in identifying the heterogeneous freezing mechanisms, atmospheric relevance, uncertainties, and unknowns about INPs are described. The change in conventional wisdom regarding the requirements of INPs as new studies discover physical and chemical properties of these particles is explained. INP sources and known reasons for their ice nucleating properties are presented. The need for more studies to systematically identify particle properties that facilitate ice nucleation is highlighted. The atmospheric relevance of long-range transport, aerosol aging, and coating studies (in the laboratory) of INPs are also presented. Possible mechanisms for processes that change the ice nucleating potential of INPs and the corresponding challenges in understanding and applying these in models are discussed. How primary ice nucleation affects total ice crystal number concentrations in clouds and the discrepancy between INP concentrations and ice crystal number concentrations are presented. Finally, limitations of parameterizing INPs and of models in representing known and unknown processes related to heterogeneous ice nucleation processes are discussed.},

abstract = {Intense thunderstorms produce rapid cloud updrafts and may be associated with a range of destructive weather events. An important ingredient in measures of the potential for intense thunderstorms is the convective available potential energy (CAPE). Climate models project increases in summertime mean CAPE in the tropics and subtropics in response to global warming, but the physical mechanisms responsible for such increases and the implications for future thunderstorm activity remain uncertain. Here, we show that high percentiles of the CAPE distribution (CAPE extremes) also increase robustly with warming across the tropics and subtropics in an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models, implying strong increases in the frequency of occurrence of environments conducive to intense thunderstorms in future climate projections. The increase in CAPE extremes is consistent with a recently proposed theoretical model in which CAPE depends on the influence of convective entrainment on the tropospheric lapse rate, and we demonstrate the importance of this influence for simulated CAPE extremes using a climate model in which the convective entrainment rate is varied. We further show that the theoretical model is able to account for the climatological relationship between CAPE and a measure of lower-tropospheric humidity in simulations and in observations. Our results provide a physical basis on which to understand projected future increases in intense thunderstorm potential, and they suggest that an important mechanism that contributes to such increases may be present in Earth's atmosphere.},

abstract = {Six Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) stations were deployed in April 2010 around Eyjafjallaj{\"{o}}kull volcano in southern Iceland. Single-station LMA observations were made during the first explosive period (14–18 April), and three-dimensional LMA observations were made during the second explosive period (5–22 May). The single-station observations revealed that continuous RF electrical activity caused by high rates of small vent discharges occurred during the first explosive period, but not the second, indicating that the strength of vent charging varied between the first and second explosive periods. During the second explosive period, very little lightning was detected between 5 and 10 May, while moderate rates of lightning were detected between 11 and 21 May, signaling that another change occurred on 11 May that affected plume electrification. The data do not make clear if it was changing eruptive activity or changing meteorological activity that resulted in the sudden onset of lightning. The plume charge structure during the second explosive period was inferred from the three-dimensional lightning data, showing that the dominant charge structure varied between a positive monopole and a negative-over-positive dipole. The predominance of a low-altitude region of positive charge and the observation that electrical activity was concentrated near the vent indicate that net positive vent charging was dominating the electrification.},

abstract = {Deep convective transport of surface moisture and pollution from the planetary boundary layer to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere affects the radiation budget and climate. This study analyzes the deep convective transport in three different convective regimes from the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry field campaign: 21 May Alabama air mass thunderstorms, 29 May Oklahoma supercell severe storm, and 11 June mesoscale convective system (MCS). Lightning data assimilation within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) is utilized to improve the simulations of storm location, vertical structure, and chemical fields. Analysis of vertical flux divergence shows that deep convective transport in the 29 May supercell case is the strongest per unit area, while transport of boundary layer insoluble trace gases is relatively weak in the MCS and air mass cases. The weak deep convective transport in the strong MCS is unexpected and is caused by the injection into low levels of midlevel clean air by a strong rear inflow jet. In each system, the magnitude of tracer vertical transport is more closely related to the vertical distribution of mass flux density than the vertical distribution of trace gas mixing ratio. Finally, the net vertical transport is strongest in high composite reflectivity regions and dominated by upward transport.},

abstract = {AbstractThe goal of this chapter is to synthesize information about what is now known about one of the three main types of clouds, cirrus, and to identify areas where more knowledge is needed. Cirrus clouds, composed of ice particles, form in the upper troposphere, where temperatures are generally below −30°C. Satellite observations show that the maximum-occurrence frequency of cirrus is near the tropics, with a large latitudinal movement seasonally. In situ measurements obtained over a wide range of cirrus types, formation mechanisms, temperatures, and geographical locations indicate that the ice water content and particle size generally decrease with decreasing temperature, whereas the ice particle concentration is nearly constant or increases slightly with decreasing temperature. High ice concentrations, sometimes observed in strong updrafts, result from homogeneous nucleation. The satellite-based and in situ measurements indicate that cirrus ice crystals typically differ from the simple, idealized geo...},

abstract = {A hail observation dataset for 1972–2013 is analyzed to examine the temporal and spatial distributions of hail occurrence in South Korea. Furthermore, using radiosonde data, three thermodynamic factors which are 700–500 hPa temperature lapse rate, water vapor mixing ratio in the lowest 100 hPa, and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and one dynamic factor which is 0–6 km bulk wind shear are calculated and their correlations with hail occurrence in South Korea are examined. Hail days per year in South Korea show a decreasing trend. The monthly variation of hail days exhibits double peaks in April and November. The minimum value of hail days appears in August, which is related to the high freezing-level height, the small midlevel temperature lapse rate, and the weak bulk wind shear. During a day, 44% of the whole hail events occur between 1200 and 1800 local standard time. Spatially, hail primarily occurs in the west coastal area and the east mountainous area of South Korea. Both the regions exhibit double peaks in the monthly variation of hail days, but the east mountainous area exhibits the later spring peak (May) and the lower hail frequency in late autumn compared to the west coastal area. The midlevel temperature lapse rate is strongly correlated with the monthly variation of hail occurrence. Hail is likely to occur when the low-level water vapor mixing ratio is in the range of $\sim$ 3–6 g kg− 1. CAPE is not strongly correlated with hail occurrence. The strong bulk wind shear is correlated with hail occurrence. The bulk wind shear is decreasing and the freezing-level height is increasing annually, which contributes to the annual decrease of hail occurrence.},

abstract = {In previous work, severe weather outbreaks have been classified either as major tornado outbreaks or as primarily nontornadic outbreaks, but the large majority of such events are of a mixed character. This study proposes a reproducible method for ranking all types of severe weather outbreaks from the period 1960-2006. Numerous nonmeteorological artifacts exist in the severe weather reports archived during this period, and many of the variables used to formulate the multivariate indices had to be detrended to reduce the effect of secular trends. The resulting outbreak rankings indicate that the methodology presented herein is able to distinguish the most significant severe weather outbreaks from intermediate outbreak days and days with a large amount of geographic scatter in the severe reports. The rankings of the most severe outbreaks and those outbreak days with a large degree of spatial scatter exhibit only limited variability when the selection of parameters and their weights are modified, but a relatively high degree of volatility is noted with the intermediate cases. This result suggests there is relatively little difference in the severity of these intermediate events. However, the particular modes of severe weather in these events can be quite different. A k-means cluster analysis of the outbreak days, using a four-dimensional representation of the multivariate indices developed, indicates that outbreak days can be separated into five groups: major tornado, wind-dominated, hail-dominated, multi-modal, and days with considerable spatial scatter of the severe reports.},

A strong electric charge accumulates through two major stages in the cloud: Stage 1 occurs near the cloud top (−30°C) in the developing stage when large space charges accumulate due to gravitational separation between negative graupel and positive snow crystals. Stage 2 occurs near the −10°C level in the mature stage. In stage 2 negative space charge greatly accumulates when negative graupel particles falling from upper levels of the cloud are combined with upward moving negative snow crystals from lower levels. Positive charging of graupel below the −10°C level plays a critical role in accumulation of the large negative space charge at that level. Electric development depends highly on microphysical processes, and different electric structures are calculated for maritime and continental thunderstorms.

abstract = {Analyses are made of the evolution of selected polarimetric radar data fields during periods immediately preceding the onset of near-surface hail indicators [high reflectivity and low differential reflectivity (Z sub(dr))] in two nonsupercellular northeastern Colorado hailstorms. The primary data were obtained from the 11-cm-wavelength, dual-polarization Colorado State University (CSU)-University of Chicago and Illinois State Water Survey radar. In one of the storms, dual-Doppler wind field syntheses were available using additional velocity data collected by the CSU Pawnee S-band radar. In both events, linear depolarization ratio (LDR) values exceeding -25 dB began to appear in the right flank of the 50-dBZ echo core region, within the 0 degree to -20 degree C environmental temperature range, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of hail at the surface. Scattering calculations suggest that the LDR enhancement may have been caused by an increasing water fraction within the growing hailstones (spongy hail), or the development of a liquid water coat under wet growth conditions. Vertical structure of the Z sub(dr) fields was also examined. As hypothesized by Conway and Zrnic, it was found that the distinctness of the positive Z sub(dr) column associated with supercooled raindrops and incompletely frozen particles above the 0 degree C height varies from storm to storm.},

abstract = {A new bulk microphysical parameterization (BMP) has been developed for use with the Weather Re-search and Forecasting (WRF) Model or other mesoscale models. As compared with earlier single-moment BMPs, the new scheme incorporates a large number of improvements to both physical processes and computer coding, and it employs many techniques found in far more sophisticated spectral/bin schemes using lookup tables. Unlike any other BMP, the assumed snow size distribution depends on both ice water content and temperature and is represented as a sum of exponential and gamma distributions. Furthermore, snow assumes a nonspherical shape with a bulk density that varies inversely with diameter as found in observations and in contrast to nearly all other BMPs that assume spherical snow with constant density. The new scheme's snow category was readily modified to match previous research in sensitivity experiments designed to test the sphericity and distribution shape characteristics. From analysis of four idealized sen-sitivity experiments, it was determined that the sphericity and constant density assumptions play a major role in producing supercooled liquid water whereas the assumed distribution shape plays a lesser, but nonnegligible, role. Further testing using numerous case studies and comparing model results with in situ and other observations confirmed the results of the idealized experiments and are briefly mentioned herein, but more detailed, microphysical comparisons with observations are found in a companion paper in this series (Part III, forthcoming).},

Furthermore, cloud droplets with BC can absorb more solar radiation and reduce their single-scattering albedo (SSA), leading to a positive cloud radiative forcing (SSA forcing) at TOA. Here we include such a process into the coupled modeling system (RegCCMS) which consists of a regional climate model (RegCM3) and a tropospheric atmosphere chemistry model (TACM) to investigate BC loading, SSA forcing, and its climatic responses in different seasons over China. The year 2003 was selected as the base year for this study. Results show high BC loadings in Sichuan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces with weak seasonal variations. The national average SSA forcing due to the cloud droplets absorption is 0.04, 0.096, 0.085, and 0.056 W/m2 at TOA, while &#8722;0.05, &#8722;0.14, &#8722;0.12, and &#8722;0.077 W/m2 at the surface in January, April, July, and October, respectively. It can reach as much as 0.6 W/m2 at TOA and &#8722;0.8 W/m2 at the surface in the regions with high BC concentration and cloud cover. Numerical experiments indicate that internal mixed BC and cloud droplet can absorb more solar radiation, then heat the air, hence reducing the cloud cover and increasing vertical velocity. On the other hand, more solar absorption due to mixture droplets can alter atmospheric and hydrologic cycle, which consequently changes the distribution of cloud cover and eventually affects surface air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. Given an above 90% confidence level of statistical significance of linear correlation between SSA forcing and climate changes, surface air temperature changes for 4 months vary from &#8722;0.0022 to +0.0103 K and precipitation changes range from &#8722;0.0047 in January to 0.029 mm/d in April. These changes show an extremely large seasonal variation; so do those of cloud amount (Max: &#8722;0.066%) and solar flux (Max: 0.21 W/m2). Owing to the small SSA forcing, its climatic responses are easily masked by internal model variability in summer season, especially for precipitation and cloud. Even so, small SSA forcing in colder seasons may lead to noticeable local surface drought or cooling. For example, precipitation decreases in Yangtze River Basin reaching 1.2 mm/d in October; surface air temperatures decrease by 0.2 to 0.4 K in east China in April. It is obvious that SSA forcing and its climate responses are weaker compared to BC direct, indirect, and semidirect effects. However, it does have nonnegligible influence on regional climate changes over China.},

abstract = {Abstract Balloon soundings were made through two supercell storms during the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study (STEPS) in summer 2000. Instruments measured the vector electric field, temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and balloon location. For the first time, soundings penetrated both the strong updraft and the rainy downdraft region of the same supercell storm. In both storms, the strong updraft had fewer vertically separated charge regions than found near the rainy downdraft, and the updraft?s lowest charge was elevated higher, its bottom being near the 40-dBZ boundary of the weak-echo vault. The simpler, elevated charge structure is consistent with the noninductive graupel?ice mechanism dominating charge generation in updrafts. In the weak-echo vault, the amount of frozen precipitation and the time for particle interactions are too small for significant charging. Inductive charging mechanisms and lightning may contribute to the additional charge regions found at lower altitudes outside the updraft. Lightning mapping showed that the in-cloud channels of a positive ground flash could be in any one of the three vertically separated positive charge regions found outside the updraft, but were in the middle region, at 6?8 km MSL, for most positive ground flashes. The observations are consistent with the electrical structure of these storms having been inverted in polarity from that of most storms elsewhere. It is hypothesized that the observed inverted-polarity cloud flashes and positive ground flashes were caused by inverted-polarity storm structure, possibly due to a larger than usual rime accretion rate for graupel in a strong updraft.},

While the original hail algorithm simply indicated whether or not a detected storm cell was producing hail, the new HDA estimates the probability of hail (any size), probability of severe-size hail (diameter ≥19 mm), and maximum expected hail size for each detected storm cell. A new parameter, called the severe hail index (SHI), was developed as the primary predictor variable for severe-size hail. The SHI is a thermally weighted vertical integration of a storm cell's reflectivity profile. Initial testing on 10 storm days showed that the new HDA performed considerably better at predicting severe hail than the original hail algorithm. Additional testing of the new HDA on 31 storm days showed substantial regional variations in performance, with best results across the southern plains and weaker performance for regions farther east.},

Identification of cells is performed by assembling contiguous regions that excel certain reflectivity thresholds. Tracking is done in that the position of a cell in a new radar image is predicted by an extrapolation procedure based on its former position; special care is taken in case of possible splitting and merging events.

abstract = {Abstract On 30 May 1998, a tornado devastated the town of Spencer, South Dakota. The Spencer tornado (rated F4 on the Fujita tornado intensity scale) was the third and most intense of five tornadoes produced by a single supercell storm during an approximate 1-h period. The supercell produced over 76% positive cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning and a peak positive CG flash rate of 18 flashes min−1 (5-min average) during a 2-h period surrounding the tornado damage. Earlier studies have reported anomalous positive CG lightning activity in some supercell storms producing violent tornadoes. However, what makes the CG lightning activity in this tornadic storm unique is the magnitude and timing of the positive ground flashes relative to the F4 tornado. In previous studies, supercells dominated by positive CG lightning produced their most violent tornado after they attained their maximum positive ground flash rate, whenever the rate exceeded 1.5 flashes min−1. Further, tornadogenesis often occurred during a lull in C...},

abstract = {Lightning activity in storms with overshooting tops and hail-producing storms over Central Europe is studied, in order to find typical lightning characteristics that can be useful in nowcasting of the severity of the storm and its ability to produce hail. The first part of the study gives the analysis of lightning activity in thunderstorms with overshooting tops (OT) for the warm part of the year (May-September) from 2009 to 2010 over central and southeastern Europe. Deep convective clouds with OT were detected in Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, using methods based on the infrared window (IRW, 10.8??m) channel and absorption channels of water vapor (WV, 6.2??m) and ozone (O<inf>3</inf>, 9.7??m) in the form of brightness temperature differences. The locations and times of the detected OT were compared to the distribution and types of lightning strokes, which were provided by the LINET Lightning Location System. The results show that the spatial distribution of lightning generally coincides with the spatial distribution of the detected OT. The largest numbers of lightning strokes and OT were found in western Hungary, southeastern Austria, northeastern Slovenia and the northern Adriatic. The largest number of OT occurred between 1600 and 1800 UTC, whereas from 0600 to 1000 UTC OT detections were rather rare. Lightning activity showed a similar temporal distribution, with an increase in lightning activity evident at or close to the time of the OT detections. At the time of and close to the location of the OT, the lightning was found to occur well above the tropopause and was clearly related to the OT of cumulonimbus clouds.In the second part of the study, lightning characteristics are studied for 35 events of hail-producing thunderstorms over Croatia in the summer months (May to September), from 2008 to 2012. The lightning distribution, also registered by LINET, was compared to hail parameters based on measurements at the hailpad polygon. A polygon with dimensions of 30. km. ??. 20. km was located in the area of highest average number of days with hail occurrence in the continental part of Croatia. In a majority of the studied cases, the number of total lightning strokes sharply increased slightly before the beginning of hailfall. At the time the hailfall started there is a brief decrease in the number of lightning strokes, followed by a sharp increase shortly after. Additionally, larger hailstones with higher kinetic energy values appeared at the beginning of the hailshower. Microphysical properties of the cloud tops, investigated using MSG SEVIRI 3.9. ??m reflectivity, i.e. profiles of the effective radii of cloud particles vs. temperature, clearly verify the presence of strong updrafts associated with hail-producing clouds.},

abstract = {Cloud electrification leads to the production of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which has an effect on ozone concentrations. Currently large uncertainties exist regarding the contribution of lightning to the global and local NOx budget, even on a per flash basis. Most lightning NOx (LNOx) models distribute the LNOx at reflectivities (Z) ≥ 20 dBZ in the horizontal, while vertically, a Gaussian distribution function with a peak at − 15 °C is used for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes and a bimodal distribution function with peaks at − 15 °C and − 45 °C is used for inter- and intra-cloud (IC) flashes. This research aims to improve our basic understanding of lightning location relative to radar Z as a function of storm and flash type. Using data from the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) and the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor data suite, the results from analyzing a multicell storm, mesoscale convective system and supercell storm showed that 29.7%, 15.9% and 6.9% of all flashes initiated in regions where Z < 20 dBZ, respectively. The bimodal lightning initiation distribution for IC flashes was also not observed for any of the three storms. In addition, it is shown that when incorporating the propagation of the flash, the percentage of NALMA lightning sources located in regions where Z < 20 dBZ increases. Finally, when comparing flash types, the results show that Hybrid flashes have consistently larger sizes than IC and CG flashes, while IC and Hybrid flashes tend to have more sources located at Z < 20 dBZ than CG flashes.},

abstract = {AbstractSevere hailstorms produce over $1 billion in insured losses annually in the United States, yet details of a given storm?s hail threat (e.g., maximum hailstone size and total hailfall) remain challenging to forecast. Previous research suggests that, in addition to maximum updraft speed, the storm-relative airflow could be equally important for hail formation and growth. This study is a first step toward determining how changes in environmental wind shear and subsequent changes in simulated supercell storm structure affect hail growth. Using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) with 500-m horizontal and 250-m vertical grid spacing, 20 idealized simulations are performed in which the thermodynamic profile remains fixed but the environmental hodograph is systematically altered. Hail growth is quantified using the hail mass mixing ratio from composites of storms over the last hour of simulation time. Hailstone growth ?pseudotrajectories? are computed from these storm composites to determine favorable embryo source regions.Results indicate that increased deep-layer east?west shear elongates the storm?s updraft in that direction, providing 1) increased volumes over which microphysically relevant hail processes can act, 2) increased hailstone residence times within the updraft, and 3) a larger potential embryo source region; together, these lead to increased hail mass. Increased low-level north?south shear, which results in hodographs with increased 0?3-km storm-relative helicity, also elongates the updraft in the north?south direction. However, hail mass is reduced owing to a separation of favorable embryo source regions (which shift southward) and available hydrometeors to serve as embryos (which shift northward).},

abstract = {Combined multiparameter radar, dual-Doppler, thermodynamic sounding, and lightning observations of 11 thunderstorms (6 from the midlatitudes, 5 from the Tropics) are examined. The thunderstorms span a wide spectrum of intensities, from weak monsoontype to severe tornadic, and include both unicellular and multicellular convection. In general, the kinematically strongest storms featured lower production of negative cloud-to-ground lightning (typically <1 min-1 flash rates for large portions of the storms' lifetimes) when compared with more moderate convection, in accord with an elevated charge mechanism. The only significant differences between intense storms that produced predominately positive cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning for a significant portion of their lifetimes (PPCG storms) and intense storms that produced little CG lightning of any polarity (low-CG storms) was that PPCG storms featured much larger volumes of significant updrafts (both >10 and >20 m s-1 and produced greater amounts of precipitation (both rain and hail). Otherwise, peak updrafts and vertical airmass fluxes were very similar between the two types of storms, and both types were linked by anomalously low production of negative CG lightning. PPCG effects in storms may result from an elevated region of negative charge (reducing negative CG flash rates) combined with enhanced net positive charge regions created by the larger volume of significant updrafts.},

abstract = {The aerosol semi-direct effect is generally explained as follows: aerosols, such as black carbon (BC) and mineral dust, absorb solar radiation, which warms and stabilizes the atmosphere, resulting in reduced cloudiness and cloud formation. However, the present study suggests that BC can intensify atmospheric instability and thus increase cloud water and precipitation if the BC is concentrated near the surface. Simulations using a global aerosol climate model, based on a general circulation model, show decreased cloud water over biomass-burning regions where BC is emitted to the free troposphere through the boundary layer. In contrast, increased cloud water is indicated over East and South Asia where BC from urban and industrial activities is concentrated near the surface. While the global mean change in the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere due to the semi-direct effect of BC is estimated to be as small as +0.06 W m(-2), regional changes in cloud water, precipitation, and shortwave radiation are suggested to be large enough to modify meteorological conditions in urban and biomass-burning regions.},

It is the first book to link these two themes - the characteristics of cyclones and their landscape impacts. Students of physical geography will find this book an authoritative source. It should also appeal to those concerned with climate change, extreme events, natural hazards, tropical islands, tropical geomorphology and hydrology, and to all those who have a general curiosity about the vast Oceania region and its remote, vulnerable islands. The volume is divided into two complementary parts. The first part explains the nature of tropical cyclones, their genesis, structure, behaviour, and extreme meteorological conditions. Future cyclone activity related to climate change is also considered. Part two deals with geomorphological and hydrological responses to tropical cyclones on South Pacific islands. Attention is focused on the effects of cyclones on coral reefs, coasts, slopes and rivers, which often lead to profound landform changes and have lasting influences on both island evolution and on the lives of the Islanders. Examples and illustrations are drawn widely from across the South Pacific. Numerous maps, informative drawings, and many spectacular photographs are used with great effect throughout, resulting in a highly readable volume. James P. Terry is Associate Professor and former Head of the School of Geography at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji.

The results showed a significant reduction of ice adhesion strength on the spin-coated sample while ice adhesion strength on the spray-coated sample was found to be unexpectedly similar to that of the uncoated sample. Indeed, this research study showed that the icephobic properties of a surface are not directly correlated to its superhydrphobicity and that further investigations, like taking icing condition effect into account, are required. It was found that icephobic behaviour of the spray coated sample improved at lower levels of liquid water content (LWC) and under icing conditions characterized by smaller water droplet size.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effect of aerosol on microphysical and electrification in thunderstorm clouds. A two-dimensional (2-D) cumulus model with electrification scheme including non-inductive and inductive charge separation is used. The concentration of aerosol particles with distribution fitted by superimposing three log-normal distributions rises from 50 to 10,000 cm−3. The results show that the response of charge separation rate to the increase of aerosol concentration is nonmonotonic. When aerosol concentration is changed from 50 to 1000 cm−3, a stronger formation of cloud droplet, graupel and ice crystal results in increasing charge separation via non-inductive and inductive mechanism. However, in the range of 1000–3000 cm−3, vapor competition arises in the decrease of ice crystal mixing ratio and the reduction of ice crystals size leads to a slightly decrease in non-inductive charge rate, while inductive charging rate has no significant change in magnitude. Above aerosol concentration of 3000 cm−3, the magnitude of charging rate which keeps steady is insensitive to the increase in aerosol concentration. The results also suggest that non-inductive charge separation between ice crystal and graupel contributes to the main upper positive charge region and the middle negative charge region. Inductive graupel–cloud droplet charge separation, on the other hand, is found to play an important role in the development of lower charge region.},

abstract = {Original results obtained with the revised version of the explicit cloud electrification module developed in the French mesoscale model MesoNH are presented. The module includes three ingredients: (i) a prognostic budget equation of the electric charges carried by each type of hydrometeor and by the positive and negative ions, (ii) a computation of the electric field by inverting the Gauss equation and (iii) a statistical algorithm to produce intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges. Electric charges are generated by non-inductive (NI) processes involving ice particles that collide in the presence of supercooled water. The geometry of the lightning flashes obeys a fractal law that characterizes the densely branched flash structures with a marked horizontal extent in electrically charged regions of the clouds. For the first time, the electrical module of MesoNH is used to simulate the electrical aspects of a heavy precipitation event over the Cevennes area in the South of France. MesoNH is initialized with "AROME" analyses of Meteo-France for the 6-8 September 2010 event that produced locally 250 to 300mm of precipitation over the Cevennes ridge. A 54hour simulation starting 6 September 2010 at 00 UTC and without electricity, is performed at 1km resolution over a 384×384km2 area in order to check the ability of the model to reproduce the very fine scale structure of the rainfall. MesoNH is then restarted on 7 September 2010 at noon for a 6hour simulation involving the full electrical module. Several aspects of the electrical state of the clouds could be simulated at this scale: the cloud charge structure, the electric field and the lightning flash characteristics. Finally a map of flash density is compared to observations taken from two conventional detection networks (LInet and ATDnet). Both networks suggest that the model produces ten times too many flashes but arguments are put forward to explain this discrepancy, e.g., filtering the less energetic flashes improves the comparison. In conclusion, this study calls for a reference evaluation of the electrical module of MesoNH against statistics of flash data at high resolution in a next planned field experiment in 2012. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {<p>Southeastern Brazil is the most populated and economically developed region of this country. Its climate consists of two distinct seasons: the dry season, extending from April to September, the precipitation is significantly reduced in comparison to that of the wet season, which extends from October to March. However, during nine days of the 2016 dry season, successive convective systems were associated with atypical precipitation events, tornadoes and at least one microburst over the southern part of this region. These events led to flooding, damages to buildings, shortages of electricity and water in several places, many injuries, and two documented deaths. The present study investigates the synoptic and dynamical features related to these anomalous events. The convective systems were embedded in an unstable environment with intense low-level jet flow and strong wind shear and were supported by a sequence of extratropical cyclones occurring over the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. These features were intensified by the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) in its phase 8 and by intense negative values of the Pacific South America (PSA) 2 mode.</p>},

abstract = {Hailstorms cause significant damage to agriculture and property in many areas of the world. Therefore, it is useful to describe the size spectrum of hail and the mechanisms of formation in more detail. One important point in the formation of hail is the role of hailstone embryos, and an understanding of their mechanism would significantly improve our understanding of the evolution of hail, as well as the predicted amount of accumulated hail on the ground. We used a cloud-resolving mesoscale model to investigate the influence of the hailstone embryos on the measured ground precipitation. In this model, both types of the hailstone embryos (graupel and frozen raindrops) are incorporated. Therefore, the model predicts the mass and number concentration of the six microphysical elements - raindrops, ice crystals, snow, graupel, frozen raindrops and hail. The cloud droplet number concentration was prescribed. Thus, the primary goal of this sensitivity study was to examine the influence of hailstone embryos on the measured ground precipitation and the duration of precipitation. Thus, we performed a numerical comparison of the two microphysical schemes, one with hailstone embryos and the other without them. The sensitivity study indicated that the microphysical scenario with hailstone embryos leads to a greater increase in accumulated hail compared with the scheme without hailstone embryos. The time of hail occurrence on the ground occurs during the early stages of cloud life in the experiment without hailstone embryos. In the second case, the hail occurrence on the ground was delayed for the later stages of cloud life, which is much more realistic and in agreement with the measurements. The use of a model with hailstone embryos leads to a better description of the evolution of hail and a more accurate prediction of the accumulated hail on the ground. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A recommendation is made for a pad constructed of 2.5 cm thick type-SI Styrofoam (manufactured by Dow Chemical USA) and sprayed with a 25–50 $\mu$m coating of white latex paint for protection from the deteriorating effects of sun-light. Calibration of the hailpad provides a relation between the minor axis of a dent in the pad and the dimensions of the stone producing the dent. It is recommended that measurements of the minor axis be categorized in size intervals no wider than 4 mm. The NHRE laboratory technique for calibrating hailpads involves simulating a hailstone impact by dropping a steel sphere onto a pad from a height such that the impact kinetic energy achieved by the sphere equals that of a hailstone of equal diameter falling onto the pad in an environment with known horizontal wind.

abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large- scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.},

The detection of both IC and CG flashes, or total lightning, enables improvements in the lead time of severe weather prediction and alerting. The Earth Networks WeatherBug Total Lightning Network (WTLN), created specifically for the detection of both IC and CG lightning strokes, covers the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean, as well as Australia and Brazil with a high density of sensors. Other areas are covered by a global low-density network for CG detection only. The properties of lightning cells preceding numerous severe storms in various locations of the contiguous United States have been studied and certain predictive patterns in the lightning cells have been identified. The time evolution of the lightning flash rate and the IC/CG ratio of individual cells are used to identify thunderstorms likely to produce damaging hail, high wind, or tornados with significant lead times before they occur. Studies have shown that early detections in the sudden rise of the rate of IC discharges and subsequent peak of total flash rate can serve as an indicator for severe storm conditions. Using WTLN lightning data, a real-time lightning cell tracking and the Earth Networks Dangerous Thunderstorm Alert (WDTA) program has been developed.},

The current GOES operational scan interval is 15–30 min, which is too coarse to capture details important for severe convective storm forecasting including 1) when indicators of a severe storm such as rapid cloud-top cooling, overshooting tops, and above-anvil cirrus plumes first appear; 2) how satellite-observed cloud tops truly evolve over time; and 3) how satellite cloud-top observations compare with radar and lightning observations at high temporal resolution. In this paper, SRSOR data, radar, and lightning observations are used to analyze five convective storms, four of which were severe, to address these uncertainties. GOES cloud-top cooling, increased lightning flash rates, and peak precipitation echo tops often preceded severe weather, signaling rapid intensification of the storm updraft. Near the time of several severe hail or damaging wind events, GOES cloud-top temperatures and radar echo tops were warming rapidly, which indicated variability in the storm updraft that could have allowed the hail and wind gusts to reach the surface. Above-anvil cirrus plumes were another prominent indicator of impending severe weather. Detailed analysis of storms throughout the 2012 SRSOR period indicates that 57% of the plume-producing storms were severe and 85% of plumes from severe storms appeared before a severe weather report with an average lead time of 18 min, 9 min earlier than what would be observed by GOES operational scanning.},

Every year, notably in the southern Brazilian States, destructive hailstorms result in serious economic losses and cause a great social impact destroying crops, homes, medical facilities and schools. The aim of this study is to document the spatial, annual, and diurnal variation in destructive hailstorm frequency during a 22 year period from 1991 to 2012 in Brazil. The analysis is based on a collection of reports released by the Brazilian National Civil Protection Secretariat – SEDEC. Based on reports of emergency assistance given to the population affected by a disaster, the information discussed in this work is assumed as representative only of destructive hailstorms. The analysis reveals a large spatial variability, with the majority of hailstorm occurrences distributed in the three southernmost Brazilian States. Within those states, the number of hail reports was observed to increase with increasing population density in rural areas. Hailstorms were reported most often in the late afternoon and evening of the winter/spring transition, in agreement with a few other areas in the subtropics with available studies, but different from the majority of studies for temperate zones, which suggest spring/summer as the hail season. Although the results show some discrepancies compared to satellite hail signatures, the findings of this work confirm that southern Brazil is a region prone to the development of strong convective storms, with high annual numbers of destructive hail events.},

Previous papers have studied the scale dependence of predictability of patterns of instantaneous rainfall rate and of probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, motivated by the often localized, intermittent nature of rainfall, the wavelet transform is used to develop measures of predictability at each scale. These measures are then used to design optimal forecast filters. This method is applied to radar composites of rainfall reflectivity over much of the continental United States and is developed to be appropriate for operational forecasts of rainfall rates and raining areas. For the four precipitation events studied, the average correlation at 4-h lead time was increased from 0.50 for the original nowcasts to 0.62 with forecast filtering. This forecast filtering is incorporated into the McGill Algorithm for Precipitation Nowcasting by Lagrangian Extrapolation ( MAPLE), which now includes variational echo tracking, a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme, scale-based filtering, and appropriate rescaling of the filtered nowcast fields.},

abstract = {It is generally believed that a strong updraft in the mixed-phase region of thunderstorms is required to produce lightning. This is the region where the noninductive charging process is thought to generate most of the storm electrification. Analytic calculations and model results predict that the total lightning frequency is roughly proportional to the product of the downward mass flux of solid precipitation (graupel) and the upward mass flux of ice crystals. Thus far this flux hypothesis has only been tested in a very limited way. Herein we use dual-polarimetric and dual-Doppler radar observations in conjunction with total lightning data collected in Northern Alabama and also Colorado/Kansas during two field campaigns. These data are utilized to investigate total lightning activity as a function of precipitation and nonprecipitation ice masses and estimates of their fluxes for different storm types in different climate regions. A total of 11 storms, including single cell, multicell, and supercell storms, was analyzed in the two climatologically different regions. Time series of both precipitation and nonprecipitation ice mass estimates above the melting level show a good relationship with total lightning activity for the 11 storms analyzed (correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 and 0.8, respectively). Furthermore, the relationships are relatively invariant between the two climate regions. The correlations between total lightning and the associated product of ice mass fluxes are even higher. These observations provide strong support for the flux hypothesis.},

abstract = {Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning detected by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) indicates a relatively high flash density over Houston, Texas, for the 12-year period 1989–2000. A significant enhancement of 45% in the flash density is observed compared to the nearby surrounding areas. The strength of the enhancement varies on the basis of season and time of day, with the greatest increases occurring during the summer (58%) and during the 0900–1800 LT time periods in each season. Observations indicate that large lightning events (defined as days with >100 flashes in a geographic region that includes Houston and nearby rural areas) were responsible for the climatological lightning anomaly and that increased thunderstorm initiation was not the most significant cause of the enhancement. A decrease (−12%) in the percentage of positive flashes is observed over the city. Higher negative median peak currents along the coast and well into the Gulf of Mexico were also discovered. Several explanations for our observations are suggested. The urban heat island and increased cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, especially from industrial pollution, are speculated to be significant factors in creating lightning enhancement. Pollution effects are speculated to cause a change in a thunderstorm's charge distribution, which can affect the polarity of CG flashes. The potential effect of the nearby coastal Gulf salt water on the calculated peak current is examined. Variations in multiplicity values across the region are observed but not explained.},

abstract = {Changes in rainfall extremes and flooding are becoming more frequent in many countries, particularly in large cities where people and assets are concentrated. In the Metropolitan Area of the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (MASP) region, heavy or extreme precipitation events have important effects on society. Flash floods and landslides, associated with intense, but often brief, rainfall events, may be the most destructive of extreme events. Observations since the mid-1930s in the MASP region have shown significant increases in total and heavy rainfall and decreases in light rain. This was probably due to natural climate variability, but with some signals of the urbanization effect, especially during the last 40 yr. Here projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in the MASP region were derived from the Eta-CPTEC 40 km regional model nested in the HadCM3 global model, with 4 available realizations of the global model for the A1B emissions scenario to the end of the 21st century. Trends were assessed for significance using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. Projections, based on percentiles and on the number of days with rainfall above a certain limit, suggested: (a) an increase in total precipitation, (b) an increase in heavy precipitation and in the contribution to total precipitation from more intense rainfall events, and (c) the possibility of longer dry periods separating days with intense rain in the MASP region. The trends were stronger and more significant in the second half of the 21st century. We are aware that dynamical downscaling may not provide information at the weather station level and that climate modeling does not resolve all uncertainties. However, we believe that this exercise enables climate assessments that, in time, can be used for general public information.},

abstract = {Abstract. Changes induced by perturbed aerosol conditions in moderately deep mixed-phase convective clouds (cloud top height ∼ 5km) developing along sea-breeze convergence lines are investigated with high-resolution numerical model simulations. The simulations utilise the newly developed Cloud–AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM) module for the Unified Model (UM), which allows for the representation of the two-way interaction between cloud and aerosol fields. Simulations are evaluated against observations collected during the COnvective Precipitation Experiment (COPE) field campaign over the southwestern peninsula of the UK in 2013. The simulations compare favourably with observed thermodynamic profiles, cloud base cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC), cloud depth, and radar reflectivity statistics. Including the modification of aerosol fields by cloud microphysical processes improves the correspondence with observed CDNC values and spatial variability, but reduces the agreement with observations for average cloud size and cloud top height. Accumulated precipitation is suppressed for higher-aerosol conditions before clouds become organised along the sea-breeze convergence lines. Changes in precipitation are smaller in simulations with aerosol processing. The precipitation suppression is due to less efficient precipitation production by warm-phase microphysics, consistent with parcel model predictions. In contrast, after convective cells organise along the sea-breeze convergence zone, accumulated precipitation increases with aerosol concentrations. Condensate production increases with the aerosol concentrations due to higher vertical velocities in the convective cores and higher cloud top heights. However, for the highest-aerosol scenarios, no further increase in the condensate production occurs, as clouds grow into an upper-level stable layer. In these cases, the reduced precipitation efficiency (PE) dominates the precipitation response and no further precipitation enhancement occurs. Previous studies of deep convective clouds have related larger vertical velocities under high-aerosol conditions to enhanced latent heating from freezing. In the presented simulations changes in latent heating above the 0°C are negligible, but latent heating from condensation increases with aerosol concentrations. It is hypothesised that this increase is related to changes in the cloud field structure reducing the mixing of environmental air into the convective core. The precipitation response of the deeper mixed-phase clouds along well-established convergence lines can be the opposite of predictions from parcel models. This occurs when clouds interact with a pre-existing thermodynamic environment and cloud field structural changes occur that are not captured by simple parcel model approaches.},

The advantage in increasing the number of radars is in the increased area covered and the accuracy with which wind estimates may be obtained. Although multiple-radar systems can yield special quantitative insight, a great deal of information can still be determined in real time from a single radar. It should be noted that the interpretation of radial velocity estimates from a single radar are not always unambiguous. Color displays of single-Doppler radial velocity patterns aid in the real-time interpretation of the associated reflectivity fields and can reveal important features not evident in the reflectivity structures alone. Such a capability is of particular interest in the identification and study of severe storms. A display utilizing a 5 cm Doppler radar is used to illustrate the patterns seen from several tornadic storms that occurred in central Oklahoma on 20 May 1977. Interpretation of ...},

Eight years' worth of day 1 and 4.5 years' worth of day 2-3 probabilistic convective outlooks from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) are converted to probability grids spanning the continental United States (CONUS). These results are then evaluated using standard probabilistic forecast metrics including the Brier skill score and reliability diagrams. Forecasts are gridded in two different ways: one with a high-resolution grid and interpolation between probability contours and another on an 80-km-spaced grid without interpolation. Overall, the highest skill is found for severe wind forecasts and the lowest skill is observed for tornadoes; for significant severe criteria, the opposite discrepancy is observed, with highest forecast skill for significant tornadoes and approximately no overall forecast skill for significant severe winds. Highest climatology-relative skill is generally observed over the central and northern Great Plains and Midwest, with the lowest-and often negative-skill seen in the West, southern Texas, and the Atlantic Southeast. No discernible year-to-year trend in skill was identified; seasonally, forecasts verified the best in the spring and late autumn and worst in the summer and early autumn. Forecasts are also evaluated in CAPE-versus-shear parameter space; forecasts struggle most in very low shear but also in high-shear, low-CAPE environments. In aggregate, forecasts for all variables verified more skillfully using interpolated probability grids, suggesting utility in interpreting forecasts as a continuous field. Forecast reliability results depend substantially on the interpretation of the forecast fields, but day 1 and day 2-3 tornado outlooks consistently exhibit an underforecast bias.},

abstract = {The climatology and the basic state of the summertime circulation and rainfall over South America are studied using assimilation products from the data assimilation system of Goddard Earth Observing System-1 (GEOS- 1) and satellite-derived rainfall. Results indicate the existence of a regional summer monsoon circulation regime induced by strong diabatic heating over the subtropical South American highland centered at the Altiplano Plateau. Sensitivity of the results to the assimilation scheme is tested by comparing that with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis and with satellite rainfall estimates. Results show general agreement between the model produced rainfall anomaly and the satellite estimates, as well as consistency between the basic circulation features in the GEOS-1 and the NCEP reanalyses. A case study of 1989–90 South American summer monsoon (SASM) reveals the following characteristics. 1) In late spring, the onset of SASM is signaled by an abrupt merging of the upper-tropospheric double westerly jets, one in the subtropics and the other in the subpolar region, into a single jet in the midlatitudes. This is followed by the establishment of a vortex to the southeast of Altiplano and occurrence of heavy pre- cipitation over subtropical eastern Brazil. 2) During the mature phase of SASM, the heavy rainfall zone moves over the Altiplano Plateau and the southernmost Brazilian highland. The fully established SASM features are the following: (a) an enhancement of equatorial North Atlantic trade wind, which emanates from the Sahara high and crosses the equator over the South American continent; (b) a buildup of strong northwesterlies along the eastern side of the tropical Andes; and (c) development of the South Atlantic convergence zone in the southernmost position with strong convective activity. Meanwhile, the upper-tropospheric return flow emerges from an anticyclone formed over the Altiplano Plateau, crosses the equator, and sinks over northwestern Africa. 3) The withdrawal of SASM in late summer is signaled by the resplitting of the midlatitude westerly jet. At the same time, the low-level northwest monsoon flow diminishes, reducing the moisture supply and leading to the termination of heavy precipitation over the subtropical highland. Results also show that the above-mentioned characteristics of SASM are clearly linked to the tropospheric temperature changes over the central South American highland. Sensible versus latent heating over the highland are bound to play an important role in the evolution of SASM. To provide further support of presence of a monsoon climate over South America, SASM is compared and contrasted to the ‘‘classic'' east Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Many similar features, including evolution characteristics between the two systems, have been identified. Contrasting aspects of the SASM from the EASM are also discussed. It is pointed out that a number of monsoonal characteristics of the climate of South America, such as the seasonal reversal of the low-level wind, become apparent only when the strong annual mean wind is removed. Based on the characteristic features and their evolution, the authors conclude that a monsoon climate does exist over South America.},

Identified overshooting convective storms are separated by their organization and intensity into three classifications: organized convection, discrete ordinary convection, and discrete supercell convection. Composite analysis of iden- tified storms for each classification reveals microphysical features similar to those found in previous studies of deep convection, with deep columns of highly positive ZDR and KDP representing lofting of liquid hydrometeors within the convective updraft and above the melting level. In addition, organized and discrete supercell classifications show distinct near-zero ZDR minima aligned horizontally with and at altitudes higher than the updraft column features, likely indicative of the frequent presence of large hail in each case. Composites for organized convective systems show a similar ZDR minimum throughout the portion of the convective core that is overshooting the tropopause, corresponding to ZH in the range of 15–30 dBZ and negative KDP observations, in agreement with the scattering properties of small hail and/or lump or conical graupel. Additional analyses of the evolution of overshooting storms reveals that the ZDR minima indicative of hail in the middle and upper troposphere and graupel in the overshooting top are associated with the mature and decaying stages of overshooting, respectively, supporting their inferred contributions to the observed polarimetric fields.},

It examines one tilt angle at a time, beginning at the highest elevation where clutter is minimal and gate-to-gate shear is typically low compared to the Nyquist velocity. It then dealiases each tilt in descending order until the entire radial velocity volume is corrected. In each tilt, the algorithm performs six simple steps. In the first two steps, a reflectivity threshold and filter are applied to the radial velocity field to remove unwanted noise. The third step initializes dealiasing by attempting to adjust the value of each gate by Nyquist intervals such that it agrees with both the nearest gate in the next higher tilt and the nearest gate in the previous volume. The gates that pass the third step at a high confidence level become the initial values for step four, which consist of correcting the neighboring gates within the scan, while preserving environmental shear as much as po...},

abstract = {As the planet warms, it is important to consider possible impacts of climate change on severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. To further that discussion, the current distribution of severe thunderstorms as a function of large-scale environmental conditions is presented. Severe thunderstorms are much more likely to form in environments with large values of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and deep-tropospheric wind shear. Tornadoes and large hail are preferred in high-shear environments and non-tornadic wind events in low shear. Further, the intensity of tornadoes and hail, given that they occur, tends to be almost entirely a function of the shear and only weakly depends on the thermodynamics.Climate model simulations suggest that CAPE will increase in the future and the wind shear will decrease. Detailed analysis has suggested that the CAPE change will lead to more frequent environments favorable for severe thunderstorms, but the strong dependence on shear for tornadoes, particularly the strongest ones, and hail means that the interpretation of how individual hazards will change is open to question. The recent development of techniques to use higher-resolution models to estimate the occurrence of storms of various kinds is discussed. Given the large interannual variability in environments and occurrence of events, caution is urged in interpreting the observational record as evidence of climate change. ?? 2012.},

According to this theory, each of the ice surfaces is covered with a film of quasi-liquid water, whose thickness can be estimated as a function of temperature and local curvature. We show that during contact of two particles, fluid will flow from the thicker to the thinner layer, and we estimate the volume transferred in atmospherically relevant situations. We postulate a charge structure within the surface-melted layer based on observations on similar systems and show that this leads to estimated charge transfers consistent in approximate magnitude and sign with trends observed in the laboratory.},

abstract = {In this study a one-dimensional numerical cloud electrification model, called the Explicit Microphysics Thun- derstorm Model (EMTM), is used to find quantitative rela- tionships between the simulated electrical activity and micro- physical properties in convective clouds. The model, based on an explicit microphysics scheme coupled to an ice–ice noninductive electrification scheme, allows us to interpret the connection of cloud microphysical structure with charge density distribution within the cloud, and to study the full evolution of the lightning activity (intracloud and cloud-to- ground) in relation to different environmental conditions. Thus, we apply the model to a series of different case stud- ies over continental Europe and the Mediterranean region. We first compare, for selected case studies, the simulated lightning activity with the data provided by the ground-based Lightning Detection Network (LINET) in order to verify the reliability of the model and its limitations, and to assess its ability to reproduce electrical activity consistent with the ob- servations. Then, using all simulations, we find a correla- tion between some key microphysical properties and cloud electrification, and derive quantitative relationships relating simulated flash rates to minimum thresholds of graupel mass content and updrafts. Finally, we provide outlooks on the use of such relationships and comments on the future develop- ment of this study.},

abstract = {Abstract Ground-and radar-measured patterns of hail kinetic energy from eight hailstorms have been compared. The radar patterns were shifted horizontally in such a way that the correlation coefficient between the ground and radar data reaches a maximum. The correlation coefficients increased from .7 (no shift) to .9 (optimal shift) on average. The “optimal” shift vector is in good agreement with conceptual models about the kinematics of the storms. The influence of microphysical effects and of the storm dynamics on the agreement between the hailpad-and radar-measured quantities is discussed in detail. The melting of hailstones and the shape of hailstone spectra have been considered in additional analyses, and the impact of these effects on the ground and radar measurements could be isolated. The results imply that the melting of hailstones is more pronounced in supercell storms than in single-cell storms or in multicell storms.},

The continuously increasing resolution of large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric models makes it feasible to treat the evolution of individual clouds. The explicit treatment of clouds requires the simulation of cloud microphysics. Two main approaches describing cloud microphysical properties and processes have been developed in the past four and a half decades: bulk microphysics parameterization and spectral (bin) microphysics (SBM). The development and utilization of both represent an important step forward in cloud modeling. This study presents a detailed survey of the physical basis and the applications of both bulk microphysics parameterization and SBM. The results obtained from simulations of a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, from tropical cyclones through Arctic clouds using these two approaches are compared. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as lines of future development for these methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Severe thunderstorms are a common occurrence in Australia and have been documented since the first European settlement in 1788. These events are characterized by large damaging hail in excess of 2cm, convective wind gusts greater than 90km h−1 and tornadoes, and contribute a quarter of all natural hazard-related losses in the country. This impact has lead to a growing body of research and insight into these events. In this article, the state of knowledge regarding their incidence, distribution, and the resulting hail, tornado, convective wind, and lightning risk will be reviewed. Applying this assessment of knowledge, the implications for forecasting, the warning process, and how these events may respond to climate change and variability will also be discussed. Based on this review, ongoing work in the field is outlined, and several potential avenues for future research and exploration are suggested. Most notably, the need for improved observational or proxy climatologies, the forecasting guidelines for tornadoes, and the need for a greater understanding of how severe thunderstorms respond to climate variability are highlighted.},

Tests on one month of data from one site show that the algorithms perform accurately and provide products that characterize the essential features of the precipitation climatology. Input to the algorithms are the operationally executed volume scans of a radar and the data from a surrounding rain gauge network. The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region. Precipitation not identified as convective is stratiform. This method avoids the problem of underestimating the stratiform precipitation. The separation criteria are...},

abstract = {Horizontal and line-normal, vertical cross-sections and composite images of Dallas-Fort Worth Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR II) VHF radiation sources and radar reflectivity over a 30-min period provide a unique perspective on lightning pathways within a leading-line, trailing-stratiform (LLTS) mesoscale convective system (MCS) on 16 June 2002. The overwhelming majority of VHF lightning sources occurred within the leading convective line in a bimodal pattern in the vertical. Assuming that VHF source density maxima were most likely associated with positive charge, then the LDAR II observations suggest that the gross charge structure of the convective region of the MCS was characterized by a tripole with net positive charge centered at 4.5 km AGL (3?C) and 9.5 km AGL (?35?C) and net negative charge centered roughly in the relative minimum of the VHF source density maximum at 7 km AGL (?17?C). A persistent lightning pathway and inferred positive charge zone sloped rearward (by 40–50 km) and downward (by 4–5 km) from the upper VHF source maximum in the convective line, through the transition zone, and into the radar bright band of the stratiform region. In the stratiform region, VHF lightning sources and inferred positive charge were concentrated in three layers centered at 4.5, 6, and 9 km AGL (2?C, ?11?C, and ?31?C, respectively), consistent with past electric field studies of symmetric LLTS MCSs. Positive cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in the stratiform region were initiated in the convective line and followed the slanting pathway from the top of convective cores to the stratiform precipitation, where they were horizontally extensive, layered, and highly branched. The sloping lightning pathway was identical to hypothetical trajectories taken by snow particles. These observations provide further support for the advection of charge on snow along the sloping pathway and the in situ generation of charge in the horizontal lightning layers as primary contributors to electrification and positive lightning production rearward of the convective line.},

This study quantitatively tests these past anecdotal observations using LMA data for two supercell storms that occurred in Oklahoma in 2004. The data support a prediction from electrostatics that frequent breakdown and large flash extents are opposed. An energetic scaling that combines flash rate and flash area exhibits a power-law scaling regime on scales of a few kilometers and a maximum in flash energy at about 10 km. The spectral shape is surprisingly consistent across a range of moderate to large flash rates. The shape of this lightning flash energy spectrum is similar to that expected of turbulent kinetic energy spectra in thunderstorms. In line...},

Synthetic radar radial velocity, reflectivity, satellite derived cloud water path (CWP) and total precipitable water (TPW) data are produced from the simulated supercell storm and then these data are assimilated into another WRF model run that starts with no convection. Two types of experiments are performed. The first assimilates radar and satellite CWP data using a perfect storm environment. The second assimilates additional TPW data using a storm environment with dry bias.

abstract = {Dual-Doppler and polarimetric radar observations are used to analyze\ntwo mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that occurred during the\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere\nfield campaign. The MCSs formed in different meteorological regimes,\nbased on profiles of atmospheric wind and thermodynamic data. The\nfirst MCS event (26 January 1999) was a squall line that formed in\nlow-level easterly flow and had an intense leading line of convection.\nIn contrast, the 25 February 1999 MCS formed in low-level westerly\nflow and was best characterized by stratiform precipitation with\nembedded convective elements. The radar analyses suggest that the\nMCSs were distinct in terms of overall vertical structure characteristics.\nIn particular, polarimetric radar cross sections indicated the presence\nof an active mixed phase zone in the easterly MCS that was largely\nabsent in the westerly case. The easterly MCS had considerably more\nprecipitation ice in the middle to upper troposphere compared to\nthe westerly MCS. Composite analyses showed that the easterly MCS\nhad higher peak reflectivities and a smaller reflectivity gradient\nabove the 0°C level in convective regions of the storm compared to\nthe westerly MCS event. Moreover, mean profiles of both vertical\nair motion and vertical mass transport in the convective portion\nof the easterly MCS were larger (over a factor of 2 at some heights\nbelow the 0°C level) than those in the westerly event. These observations\nsuggest that the easterly and westerly wind regimes in the southwest\nAmazon region produce convection with different vertical structure\ncharacteristics, similar to regimes elsewhere in the global tropics\n(e.g., maritime continent).},

Results indicate that local maximums in CG lightning were indeed accompanied by peaks in IM. Extending previous global findings to cell-scales, we establish a link between a storm's ability to generate enhanced concentrations of mixed-phase IM, and its ability to generate lightning. Relative to the documented CG lightning “anomaly” over Houston, these results imply that unique aspects of the Houston urban area must first generate an anomaly in convective intensity and precipitation ice, thereby generating an anomaly in lightning; causal hypotheses must be capable of explaining either increased frequency and/or intensity of convection, and then relating these to the enhancement of IM and lightning production.},

abstract = {Statistics of tropical cyclone origin in the Australian region are presented for the period July 1959-June 1979. Cyclone genesis is found to occur in preferred areas and to have a high incidence of coastline developments, often with the precursor system forming over land. There is an average of 1.3 occurrences per year of ‘regeneration' whereby a cyclone develops from a pre-existing cyclone which has lost intensity after crossing on to the continent. A synoptic analysis of individual developments over five years reveals that 84 per cent of the pre-cyclone cloud clusters first appear on the gradient level monsoon shear line, whereas 97 per cent are on the shearline at the point of development. Statistical evidence is given for the enhancement of lower and upper level vorticity fields by mid-latitude systems prior to cyclone genesis, but on a case by case basis the role of these systems is highly variable. The structure of the pre-cyclone systems for individual cases and composites shows the upper level warm core and large scale cyclonic surrounding circulation in the middle and lower troposphere, known to exist for similar systems in other parts of the world. At upper levels the systems are surrounded by tangential winds in the anticyclonic sense beyond 6 degrees latitude radius.},

Besides the lightning measurements from TRMM, the radar reflectivities and passive microwave brightness temperatures have been used as proxies for convective vigor. This is based on large graupel or hail lofted by strong updrafts being the cause of high–radar reflectivity values aloft and extremely low brightness temperatures. This paper seeks to empirically confirm that extremely low brightness temperatures are often accompanied by large hail at the surface. The three frequencies examined (85, 37, and 19 GHz) all show an increasing likelihood of hail reports with decreasing brightness temperature. Quantification is limited by the sparsity of hail reports. Hail reports are common when brightness temperatures are below 70 K at 85 GHz, 180 K at 37 GHz, or 230 K at 19 GHz.},

MJO-related SSS changes are consistent with E-P forcing in the western Indian Ocean throughout the MJO cycle and in the central Indian Ocean during the wet phase of the MJO cycle. However, SSS changes cannot be explained by E-P in the central Indian Ocean during the dry phase and in the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans throughout the MJO cycle, implying the importance of ocean dynamics. SSS has an overall larger contribution to MJO-related surface density and potential energy anomalies than SST. It partially offsets the SST effect in the western-to-central Indian Ocean and reinforces the SST effect in the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Ocean modeling and assimilation need to properly account for salinity effects in order to correctly represent mixed layer variability associated with the MJO. Our results also clarify some discrepancy in previous studies about the E-P effect on MJO-related SSS variations.},

The regions of enhanced Zdr and Kdp are likely related to the growth of dendrite crystals in the region where the difference between the saturation vapor pressure over water and the saturation vapor pressure over ice is greatest. Coincident C-band and X-band measurements, in conjunction with electromagnetic scattering simulations, demonstrate that Kdp scales with frequency, indicating that the ice particles in the vapor deposition preferential growth zone are Rayleigh scatterers.

Convection?permitting simulations of 10 high?impact weather case studies over Greece are compared against lightning observations from the ZEUS ground?based lightning detection network. The model's ability to accurately simulate these convective events is first evaluated through statistical scores of accumulated rainfall. The simulated flash origin density (FOD) fields are then assessed using statistical neighborhood methods. Overall, the simulated FOD fields have good agreement with the observations. Most of the lightning activity over the sea, however, is generally poorly forecasted. Lightning?producing events over the sea near Greece mainly occur during the cold season. Thus, lightning forecast with E?WRF appear to have better skill during the warm season. The simulated areal coverage of FOD using E?WRF also reduces the false alarms of lightning activity both over land and sea compared to a well?documented diagnostic lightning prediction scheme. Given its relatively low computational cost, these results support the potential use of E?WRF for real?time lightning predictions at convection?allowing scales.},

abstract = {The Beijing 2008 Forecast Demonstration Project (B08FDP) included a variety of nowcasting systems from China, Australia, Canada, and the United States. A goal of the B08FDP was to demonstrate state-of-the-art nowcasting systems within a mutual operational setting. The nowcasting systems were a mix of radar echo extrapolation methods, numerical models, techniques that blended numerical model and extrapolation methods, and systems incorporating forecaster input. This paper focuses on the skill of the nowcasting systems to forecast convective storms that threatened or affected the Summer Olympic Games held in Beijing, China. The topography surrounding Beijing provided unique challenges in that it often enhanced the degree and extent of storm initiation, growth, and dissipation, which took place over short time and space scales. The skill levels of the numerical techniques were inconsistent from hour to hour and day to day and it was speculated that without assimilation of real-time radar reflectivity and Doppler velocity fields to support model initialization, particularly for weakly forced convective events, it would be very difficult for models to provide accurate forecasts on the nowcasting time and space scales. Automated blending techniques tended to be no more skillful than extrapolation since they depended heavily on the models to provide storm initiation, growth, and dissipation. However, even with the cited limitations among individual nowcasting systems, the Chinese Olympic forecasters considered the B08FDP human consensus forecasts to be useful. Key to the success of the human forecasts was the development of nowcasting rules predicated on the character of Beijing convective weather realized over the previous two summers. Based on the B08FDP experience, the status of nowcasting convective storms and future directions are presented.},

abstract = {Because explicit prediction of the electrical activity in storms is computationally expensive and the processes are still poorly understood, an attractive way to predict lightning flash rates in numerical models is to rely on correlations between the flash rate and available model parameters. Predicted flash rates can be used for applications such as the parameterization to infer lightning-produced nitrogen oxides. In this study, the potential for six model parameters (precipitation ice mass, ice water path, ice mass flux product, updraft volume, maximum vertical velocity, and cloud top height) to predict lightning rate has been investigated in a cloud-resolving model framework. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is used to simulate two different storms: the 10 July 1996 severe storm that occurred over the High Plains and the 13 July 2005 airmass thunderstorm near Huntsville, Alabama. It is shown that the WRF model reproduces the structure of the two storms. Results show that the maximum updraft velocity gives a good flash rate proxy for the severe storm. The ice mass flux product and precipitation ice mass can reproduce the flash rate trend but not the magnitude. The flash rate estimated from the cloud top height does not match the observed flash rate trend and value of the severe storm, but is in good agreement for the airmass thunderstorm. The ice water path predicts flash rate fairly well for the severe storm, but overpredicts it for the airmass thunderstorm. The updraft volume predicts flash rate poorly for both storms.},

abstract = {This study presents the assimilation of total lightning data to help initiate convection at cloud-resolving scales within a numerical weather prediction model. The test case is the 24 May 2011 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, which was characterized by an exceptional synoptic/mesoscale setup for the development of long-lived supercells with large destructive tornadoes. In an attempt to reproduce the observed storms at a pre-determined analysis time, total lightning data were assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and analyzed via a suite of simple numerical experiments. Lightning data assimilation forced deep, moist precipitating convection to occur in the model at roughly the locations and intensities of the observed storms as depicted by observations from the National Severe Storms Laboratory's three-dimensional National Mosaic and Multisensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE)—i.e., NMQ—radar reflectivity mosaic product. The nudging function for the total lightning data locally increases the water vapor mixing ratio (and hence relative humidity) via a simple smooth continuous function using gridded pseudo-Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) resolution (9 km) flash rate and simulated graupel mixing ratio as input variables. The assimilation of the total lightning data for only a few hours prior to the analysis time significantly improved the representation of the convection at analysis time and at the 1-h forecast within the convective permitting and convective resolving grids (i.e., 3 and 1 km, respectively). The results also highlighted possible forecast errors resulting from errors in the initial mesoscale thermodynamic variable fields. Although this case was primarily an analysis rather than a forecast, this simple and compu-tationally inexpensive assimilation technique showed promising results and could be useful when applied to events characterized by moderate to intense lightning activity.},

abstract = {The remote atmosphere over the Amazon can be similar to oceanic regions in terms aerosol conditions and cloud type formations. This is especially true during the wet season. The main aerosol-related disturbances over the Amazon have both natural sources, such as dust transport from Africa, and anthropogenic sources, such as biomass burning or urban pollution. The present work considers the impacts of the latter on the microphysical properties of warm-phase clouds by analyzing observations of the interactions between Manaus city and its surroundings, as part of the GoAmazon2014/5 Experiment. The analyzed period corresponds to the wet season over a tropical rain forest (i.e., Feb to Mar 2014 and corresponding to the first Intensive Operating Period (IOP1) of GoAmazon2014/5), and the droplets observed are in the range 1 $\mu$m ≤ D ≤ 50 $\mu$m. The wet season largely presents a clean background atmosphere characterized by frequent rain showers. As such, the contrast between background clouds compared to those affected by the Manaus pollution can be observed and detailed. The focus is on the characteristics of the initial microphysical properties in cumulus clouds predominantly at their early stages. The pollution-affected clouds are found to have lower effective diameters and higher droplet number concentrations. The average differences range from 10% to 40% for the effective diameter and are as high as 1000% for droplet concentration across different vertical levels (0 to 3200 m). The growth rates of droplets with altitude are slower for pollution-affected clouds (2.90 compared to 5.59 $\mu$m km-1), as explained by the absence of bigger droplets at the onset of cloud development. Clouds under background conditions have higher concentrations of larger d roplets (e.g., > 20 $\mu$m) close to cloud base, which would contribute significantly to the growth rates through the collision-coalescence process. The droplet size distribution (DSD) overall shape do not appear to be predominantly determined by updraft strength, especially beyond the 20 $\mu$m range. The aerosol conditions play a major role in that case. However, the updrafts modulate the DSD concentrations and are responsible for the vertical transport of water in the cloud. The larger droplets found in background clouds are associated with weak water vapour competition and a bimodal distribution of droplets in the lower levels of the cloud, that enables an earlier initiation of collision-coalescence process. This study shows that the pollution produced by Manaus affects significantly warm-phase microphysical properties of the surrounding clouds by changing the initial DSD formation. The corresponding effects on ice-phase processes and precipitation formation should be the focus of future endeavors.},

abstract = {Measurements have been made of charge transfer when vapor grown ice crystals rebound from a riming target representing a graupel pellet falling in a thunderstorm. Earlier studies in the laboratory in C6rdoba of charge transfer between an individual falling ice sphere and a riming target noted that the sign of the charge transfer was dependent upon temperature and effective liquid water content (EW). The new work uses a similar experimental technique; however, a cloud of ice crystals is grown in order to study multiple interactions with the riming target. The results also show charge sign dependence on temperature and EW; positive rimer charging is observed at high temperatures and for low and high values of EW at low temperature, while negative rimer charging is noted at low temperatures for intermediate values of EW. These results are similar to those obtained by Takahashi (1978) and, as has been reported before, are rather different from those obtained in Manchester by Jayaratne et al. (1983), Saunders et al. (1991), and Saunders and Peck (1998). Significant differences between the two types of data sets are attributed to the experimental techniques used in the various studies. In the present work the ice crystal cloud and the cloud of supercooled droplets responsible for riming the target are grown in separate chambers and then mixed shortly before the crystals and droplets encounter the riming target, so that the droplet cloud is not depleted by the growing ice crystals. In the Manchester experiments, the ice crystals grow in the same supercooled droplet cloud used to rime the target. It is possible that the mixing process provides an undepleted droplet cloud and a transient enhanced vapor supply that affects both the ice crystal and graupel vapor depositional growth rates, leading to the present results.},

abstract = {Over a region from the Kansas/Colorado border to Minnesota, previously associated with positive anomalies in the mean annual positive cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning percentage and positive peak current, we describe significant differences in the properties of CG lightning flashes between warm-season severe (i.e., large hail or tornado producing) and nonsevere storms. The percentage of CG lightning flashes lowering positive charge to ground was substantially higher in severe storms (i.e., up to three times higher). The median positive peak current in severe storms was significantly larger (i.e., by about 25%). Finally, the median negative peak current in severe storms was very low (i.e., as low as 12–16 kA) and was noticeably smaller than in nonsevere storms (i.e., by at least 10%). Severe storms appeared to be significant producers of positive CG lightning in the anomaly region (AR). Up to 30%–70% of warm season positive flashes in the AR were associated with severe storms. Only 2%–30% of negative flashes were associated with severe storms in the AR. As a result, the mean warm season (and likely annual) positive anomalies in positive CG percentage and peak current are likely associated with a unique class of severe, organized storms that occur preferentially in this geographical region. We found substantial differences in the properties of CG lightning flashes associated with severe storms in other regions. For example, the mean warm season properties of CG lightning associated with severe storms in the region of peak large hail and tornado activity (e.g., Oklahoma) were fundamentally different (i.e., significantly lower positive CG percentage, lower positive peak currents and higher negative peak currents) compared to severe storms over the AR from western Kansas to Minnesota.},

abstract = {In numerical weather prediction models, previous approaches have employed bulk parameterization schemes based on presumed-number-density-functions or quadrature methods of moments (QMOM). In the present work, a new parameterization based on the extended quadrature method of moments (EQMOM) introduced in Yuan et al. (2012) is applied to the case of pure sedimentation of rain drops (one-dimensional “rain-shaft” test case). In EQMOM, the drop size distribution is represented by a weighted sum of kernel density functions, combining elements of quadrature and presumed functional form methods. In cloud microphysics, moment parameterization is frequently based on Gamma distributions, which guided the choice of the kernel shape employed here. EQMOM allows inclusion of a number of prognostic moments in the method (e.g. M(0)-M(6)), which improves flexibility in the representation of a continuous size distribution. QMOM and EQMOM up to order 3 were applied in two drop sedimentation test cases previously presented in the literature, in which initial states consist of different cloud heights and drop size distribution shapes. Results were compared to a spectral reference model using a number of transported bin sizes showing good agreement. The analysis was focused in the sedimentation induced errors obtained by the different approaches. In QMOM, size sorting due to different fall velocities generates step patterns in the moment profiles. With EQMOM, on the other hand, these artifacts are significantly suppressed. Furthermore, predictions of the number concentration, total liquid content, radar reflectivity, mass mean diameter and rain rates are shown to be greatly improved when EQMOM is employed. Quantitatively, EQMOM is capable of reducing global error measures by nearly one order of magnitude, when compared to results obtained by previous methods in a common benchmark, showing the great potential of the method in the field of meteorology.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments. Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth's climate and water supply.},

The role of vertical shear in the propagation of, and rotation in, supercells is described in detail. How cold pool production, buoyancy, and environmental vertical shear control the structure of mesoscale convective systems is discussed and the mechanism for the production of vortices in them is described. The wind field in tornadoes based on laboratory experiments, simulations, and observations is explained from the dynamics of vortices that interact with an underlying surface. Various theories for tornado formation are presented and evaluated. Avenues for future research using both numerical simulations and new and emerging observing systems are highlighted.},

The present Part I is restricted to the study of the kinematic structure of the system, which moved in a moderately unstable atmosphere, faster than the environmental air at all levels. At the observation time, the squall line was in a mature stage. The explicit description of the airflow within the system was inferred from dual- and single-Doppler radar data. The general characteristics of the squall line are found to be very similar to those of tropical squall lines observed during previous experiments such as VHIMEX or GATE: a large cloud system composed of an organized convective line ahead of an extensive trailing anvil cloud (stratiform rain), fast motion and long-lasting structure and a well-marked gust front signature at ground level. The overall airflow presents a three-dimensional structure. At the leading edge, convective-scale updrafts a...},

abstract = {The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite has been utilized for the first time in a study regarding lightning activity modulation due to aerosols. Lightning activity observations, obtained by the ZEUS long range Lightning Detection Network, European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) data and Cloud Fraction (CF) retrieved by MODIS on board Aqua satellite have been combined with CALIPSO CALIOP data over the Mediterranean basin and for the period March to November, from 2007 to 2014. The results indicate that lightning activity is enhanced during days characterized by higher Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values, compared to days with no lightning. This study contributes to existing studies on the link between lightning activity and aerosols, which have been based just on columnar AOD satellite retrievals, by performing a deeper analysis into the effect of aerosol profiles and aerosol types. Correlation coefficients of R = 0.73 between the CALIPSO AOD and the number of lightning strikes detected by ZEUS and of R = 0.93 between ECMWF CAPE and lightning activity are obtained. The analysis of extinction coefficient values at 532 nm indicates that at an altitudinal range exists, between 1.1 km and 2.9 km, where the values for extinction coefficient of lightning-active and non-lightning-active cases are statistically significantly different. Finally, based on the CALIPSO aerosol subtype classification, we have investigated the aerosol conditions of lightning-active and non-lightning-active cases. According to the results polluted dust aerosols are more frequently observed during non-lightning-active days, while dust and smoke aerosols are more abundant in the atmosphere during the lightning-active days.},

To accomplish this goal, a C-band polarimetric radar was deployed in the Tropics (11.6°S, 130.8°E) for the first time, accompanied by a suite of lightning measurements. Using observations of the propagation-corrected horizontal reflectivity and differential reflectivity, along with specific differential phase, rain and ice masses were estimated during the entire life cycle of an electrically active tropical convective complex (known locally as Hector) over the Tiwi Islands on 28 November 1995. Hector's precipitation structure as inferred from these raw and derived radar fields was then compared in time and space to the measured surface electric field, cloud-to-ground (CG) and total lightning flash rates, and ground strike locations.

abstract = {This study investigates how the summer thunderstorms developed over the city of S{{\~{a}}}o Paulo and if the pollution might affect its development or characteristics during the austral summer (December–January–February–March, DJFM months). A total of 605 days from December 1999 to March 2004 was separated as 241 thunderstorms days (TDs) and 364 non-thunderstorm days (NTDs). The analyses are performed by using hourly measurements of air temperature (T), web-bulb temperature (Tw), surface atmospheric pressure (P), wind velocity and direction, rainfall and thunder and lightning observations collected at the Meteorological Station of the University of S{{\~{a}}}o Paulo in conjunction with aerosol measurements obtained by AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network), and the NCEP-DOE (National Centers for Environmental Prediction Department of Energy) reanalysis and radiosondes. The wind diurnal cycle shows that for TDs the morning flow is from the northwest rotating to the southeast after 16:00 local time (LT) and it remains from the east until the night. For the NTDs, the wind is well characterized by the sea-breeze circulation that in the morning has the wind blowing from the northeast and in the afternoon from the southeast. The TDs show that the air temperature diurnal cycle presents higher amplitude and the maximum temperature of the day is 3.2 °C higher than in NTDs. Another important factor found is the difference between moisture that is higher during TDs. In terms of precipitation, the TDs represent 40{%} of total of days analyzed and those days are responsible for more than 60{%} of the total rain accumulation during the summer, for instance 50{%} of the TDs had more than 15.5 mm day− 1 while the NTDs had 4 mm day− 1. Moreover, the rainfall distribution shows that TDs have higher rainfall rate intensities and an afternoon precipitation maximum; while in the NTDs there isn't a defined precipitation diurnal cycle. The wind and temperature fields from NCEP reanalysis concur with the local weather station and radiosonde observations. The NCEP composites show that TDs are controlled by synoptic circulation characterized by a pre-frontal situation, with a baroclinic zone situated at southern part of S{{\~{a}}}o Paulo. In terms of pollution, this study employed the AERONET data to obtain the main aerosol characteristics in the atmospheric column for both TDs and NTDs. The particle size distribution and particle volume size distribution have similar concentrations for both TDs and NTDs and present a similar fine and coarse mode mean radius. In respect to the atmospheric loading, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at different frequencies presented closed mean values for both TDs and NTDs that were statistically significant at 95{%} level. The spectral dependency of those values in conjunction with the Angstrom parameter reveal the higher concentration of the fine mode particles that are more likely to be hygroscopic and from urban areas. In summary, no significant aerosol effect could be found on the development of summer thunderstorms, suggesting the strong synoptic control by the baroclinic forcing for deep convective development.},

abstract = {A significant enhancement in the number of negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning and a decrease in the percentage of positive CG flashes are observed over the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, similar to observations in other large urban areas. Strong evidence indicates that this anomalous behavior results from several mechanisms related to the urban effect. In this paper, we investigated the importance of the air pollution using CG lightning data provided by the Brazilian lightning detection network (BrasilDAT) for a 6-year period (1999–2004). Due to the large variations in the CG lightning activity in response to different meteorological processes, it is not an easy task to infer the contribution of air pollution to the enhancement in the lightning activity. In order to overcome such difficulty, two approaches were considered: (1) the weekly variation of the number of days with lightning in comparison to the mean concentration of particulate matter (PM10), as well as other thermodynamical parameters; (2) the variation of the number of CG flashes and the maximum storm flash rate per individual thunderstorm for different levels of pollution. The results of both analyses suggest that: first, the enhancement in the CG lightning activity during the week days over S{\~{a}}o Paulo metropolitan region is related to the PM10 concentration (pollution); second, the PM10 concentration tends to increase the lifetime of the storms and, in consequence, the number of flashes per storm, and not the flash rate of the thunderstorm; and third, the effect of the pollution in the enhancement of the CG lightning activity is probably less significant compared to the effect of the urban heat island.},

In this work, we analyze hail frequencies in one of the most affected areas by this phenomenon in Europe, southern France. Here, an extensive hail detection network has been in operation since 1988. In general, the detection of hailfall is very uncertain. To overcome the constraints of scarcity and poor standardization of hail detection and monitoring systems, some relationships between hailstorm occurrence and synoptic, mesoscale or thermodynamic atmospheric characteristics have been proposed in different areas. Therefore, we analyzed meteorological fields at synoptic scale that are related to the formation of hailstorms in the study area, i.e., geopotential height at 500 hPa, sea level pressure, and lapse-rate between 850 and 500 hPa. These fields describe the state of the atmosphere at low and mid levels, and facilitate the evaluation of thermal and dynamic instability. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen estimator, we examined trends in the three fields during the period 1948–2015 and their spatial patterns, revealing an evolution toward synoptic environments that favor hail precipitation in the Mediterranean region.},

The concept of aerodynamic molding is found to be inapplicable to the growth and shape of natural hailstones, with the possible exception of small stones and icicle lobe structures.

The 202 cells were observed within a radius of 60 km from the 10 cm radar. Different Cartesian networks with grid sizes of 0.5–4km are constructed and used to determine estimates of global kinetic energies of the hail cells. From the investigation of these estimates it is found that the normalized standard deviation (s/E) decreases with the square root of increasing global kinetic energy E and increases with decreasing density of the network: doubling the grid size causes about a factor of 3 change in (s/E). The results can be approximated by a simple relation: E is in MJ and the grid size in km. For networks with a grid size of 2 km and large kinetic energy hailfalls (E ≈ 10 GJ), one finds a normalized standard deviation of ∼ 10%, whereas a value of ∼100% and more is found for small kinetic energy hailfalls (E ≈ 0.1 GJ).

abstract = {Estimating raindrop size has been a long-standing objective of polarimetric radar-based precipitation retrieval methods. The relationship between the differential reflectivity Z^sub dr^ and the median volume diameter D^sub 0^ is typically derived empirically using raindrop size distribution observations from a disdrometer, a raindrop physical model, and a radar scattering model. Because disdrometers are known to undersample large raindrops, the maximum drop diameter D^sub max^ is often an assumed parameter in the rain physical model. C-band Z^sub dr^ is sensitive to resonance scattering at drop diameters larger than 5 mm, which falls in the region of uncertainty for D^sub max^. Prior studies have not accounted for resonance scattering at C band and D^sub max^ uncertainty in assessing potential errors in drop size retrievals. As such, a series of experiments are conducted that evaluate the effect of D^sub max^ parameterization on the retrieval error of D^sub 0^ from a fourth-order polynomial function of C-band Z^sub dr^ by varying the assumed D^sub max^ through the range of assumptions found in the literature. Normalized bias errors for estimating D^sub 0^ from C-band Z^sub dr^ range from -8% to 15%, depending on the postulated error in D^sub max^. The absolute normalized bias error increases with C-band Z^sub dr^, can reach 10% for Z^sub dr^ as low as 1-1.75 dB, and can increase from there to values as large as 15%-45% for larger Z^sub dr^, which is a larger potential bias error than is found at S and X band. Uncertainty in D^sub max^ assumptions and the associated potential D^sub 0^ retrieval errors should be noted and accounted for in future C-band polarimetric radar studies.},

For some of these (e.g., annual cycle of the diurnal cycle), more smoothing is necessary for results to be robust.The mean global flash rate from the merged climatology is 46flashess-1. This varies from around 35flashess-1 in February (austral summer) to 60flashess-1 in August (boreal summer). The peak annual flash rate at 0.5?? scale is 160flkm-2yr-1 in eastern Congo. The peak monthly average flash rate at 2.5?? scale is 18flkm-2mo-1 from early April to early May in the Brahmaputra Valley of far eastern India. Lightning decreases in this region during the monsoon season, but increases further north and west. An August peak in northern Pakistan also exceeds any monthly averages from Africa, despite central Africa having the greatest yearly average. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Town Energy Budget (TEB) model, a detailed urban parameterisation using a generalised canyon geometry, coupled with the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS) is used to simulate the wintertime local circulation in the megacity environment of the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP) in Brazil. Model simulations are performed using actual topography and land-use fields. Comparison with a simple urban parameterisation based on the LEAF-2 scheme is also shown. Validation is based on comparison between model simulations and observations. Sensitivity tests with TEB reveal an important interaction between the sea breeze and the MASP heat island circulation. Even though topography is known to play an important role in the MASP region's weather, in these tests the simulations were performed without topography in order to unambiguously identify the interaction between the two local circulations. The urban heat island (UHI) forms a strong convergence zone in the centre of the city and thereby accelerates the sea-breeze front toward the centre of the city. The presence of the urban region increases the sea-breeze front propagation mean speed by about 0.32 m s−1 when compared with the situation of no city. After its arrival in the urban region, the sea-breeze front stalls over the centre of the city for about 2 h. Subsequently, the sea breeze progresses beyond the city when the heat island dissipates. Thereafter, the sea breeze propagates beyond the urban area at a decelerated rate compared to a simulation without an UHI.},

abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) is the next block of four satellites to follow the existing GOES constellation currently operating over the Western Hemisphere. Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8. km with a product refresh rate of less than 20. s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Aerosols that act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play a crucial role in the formation of cloud particles and recent research suggests that CCN can influence ice processes within deep convection as well. In this study, a triple-moment bulk hail microphysics scheme is used to investigate the impact of changing CCN concentrations on hail for a well-observed supercell storm that occurred over northwest Kansas on 29 June 2000 during the Severe Thunderstorm and Electrification and Precipitation Study (STEPS). For the simulated supercells in the particular environment examined, an increase in potential CCN concentrations from 100 to 3000cm-3leads to increasing numbers and decreasing sizes of cloud droplets, as expected, yet the overall storm dynamics and evolution are largely unaffected. Increases in potential CCN concentrations lead to non-monotonic responses in the bulk characteristics of nearly all hydrometeor fields, surface precipitation, and cold-pool strength. However, higher concentrations of CCN also result in larger hail sizes and greater amounts of large diameter (≥2cm) hail. The results suggest that a combination of increased sizes and localized reductions in numbers of hail embryos near favorable growth regions with increasing potential CCN concentrations tend to promote conditions that lead to increased hail sizes and amounts of large hail. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A multi-sensor study of the leading-line, trailing-stratiform (LLTS) mesoscale convective system (MCS) that developed over Texas in the afternoon of 7 April 2002 is presented. The analysis relies mainly on operationally available data sources such as GOES East satellite imagery, WSR-88D radar data and NLDN cloud-to-ground flash data. In addition, total lightning information in three dimensions from the LDAR II network in the Dallas-Ft. Worth region is used. GOES East satellite imagery revealed several ring-like cloud top structures with a diameter of about 100 km during MCS formation. The Throckmorton tornadic supercell, which had formed just ahead of the developing linear MCS, was characterized by a high CG+ percentage below a V-shaped cloud top overshoot north of the tornado swath. There were indications of the presence of a tilted electrical dipole in this storm. Also this supercell had low average CG- first stroke currents and flash multiplicities. Interestingly, especially the average CG+ flash multiplicity in the Throckmorton storm showed oscillations with an estimated period of about 15 min. Later on, in the mature LLTS MCS, the radar versus lightning activity comparison revealed two dominant discharge regions at the back of the convective leading edge and a gentle descent of the upper intracloud lightning region into the trailing stratiform region, apparently coupled to hydrometeor sedimentation. There was evidence for an inverted dipole in the stratiform region of the LLTS MCS, and CG+ flashes from the stratiform region had high first return stroke peak currents. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Accurate prediction of total lightning flash rate in thunderstorms is important to improve estimates of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by lightning (LNOx) fromthe storm scale to the global scale. In this study, flash rate parameterization schemes from the literature are evaluated against observed total flash rates for a sample of 11 Colorado thunderstorms, including nine storms from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment inMay-June 2012. Observed flash rates were determined using an automated algorithm that clusters very high frequency radiation sources emitted by electrical breakdown in clouds and detected by the northern Colorado lightning mapping array. Existing schemes were found to inadequately predict flash rates and were updated based on observed relationships between flash rate and simple storm parameters, yielding significant improvement. The most successful updated scheme predicts flash rate based on the radar-derived mixed-phase 35 dBZ echo volume. Parameterizations based on metrics for updraft intensity were also updated but were found to be less reliable predictors of flash rate for this sample of storms. The 35 dBZ volume scheme was tested on a data set containing radar reflectivity volume information for thousands of isolated convective cells in different regions of the U.S. This scheme predicted flash rates to within 5.8% of observed flash rates on average. These results encourage the application of this scheme to larger radar data sets and its possible implementation into cloud-resolving models.},

The ENTLN CP values were 28.5%, 63.3%, 2.2%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively. During the 18 months, WWLLN CP values remained rather consistent but low and often higher over ocean than land ; ENTLN CP values showed large spatial and temporal variability. With both networks, North America had less variability during summer months than winter months and higher CP values during winter months than summer months. The highest ENTLN CP values were found in the southeastern United States, especially in a semicircle that extended from central Oklahoma, through Texas, along the northern Gulf of Mexico, across southern Florida, and along the U.S. East Coast. There was no significant change in CP values over time; the lowest monthly North American ENTLN CP value was found in June 2011 at 48.1%, the last month analyzed. These findings are consistent with most ENTLN sensors being located in the United States.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new object-based storm tracking algorithm, based upon TITAN (Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis and Nowcasting). TITAN is a widely-used convective storm tracking algorithm but has limitations in handling small-scale yet high-intensity storm entities due to its single-threshold identification approach. It also has difficulties to effectively track fast-moving storms because of the employed matching approach that largely relies on the overlapping areas between successive storm entities. To address these deficiencies, a number of modifications are proposed and tested in this paper. These include a two-stage multi-threshold storm identification, a new formulation for characterizing storm's physical features, and an enhanced matching technique in synergy with an optical-flow storm field tracker, as well as, according to these modifications, a more complex merging and splitting scheme. High-resolution (5-min and 529-m) radar reflectivity data for 18 storm events over Belgium are used to calibrate and evaluate the algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the original TITAN. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can better isolate and match convective rainfall entities, as well as to provide more reliable and detailed motion estimates. Furthermore, the improvement is found to be more significant for higher rainfall intensities. The new algorithm has the potential to serve as a basis for further applications, such as storm nowcasting and long-term stochastic spatial and temporal rainfall generation.},

abstract = {Space monitoring of aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends over megacities can serve as a potential space indicator of global anthropogenic air-pollution changes. Three space aerosol sensors, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua and MISR, were used in order to study recent decadal trends of AOD over megacities around the world. Space monitoring of AOD trends has the advantage of global coverage and applies the same approach to detecting AOD trends over different sites. In spite of instrumental and time differences among the three sensors investigated, their global pictures of AOD trends over the 189 largest cities in the world are quite similar. The increasing AOD trends over the largest cities in the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and North China can be clearly seen. By contrast, megacities in Europe, the north-east of US, and South-East Asia show mainly declining AOD trends. In the cases where all three sensors show similar signs of AOD trends, the results can be considered as reliable. This is supported by the observed trends in surface solar radiation, obtained by using network pyranometer measurements in North and South China, India, and Europe. In the cases where the three sensors show differing signs of AOD trends (e.g. South America), additional research is required in order to verify the obtained AOD trends.},

@article{Biggerstaff2005a,
abstract = {Abstract A group of scientists from three universities across two different states and from one federal research laboratory joined together to build and deploy two mobile C-band Doppler weather radars to enhance research and promote meteorological education. This 5-yr project led to the development of the Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching (SMART) radar coalition that built the first mobile C-band Doppler weather radar in the United States and also successfully deployed the first mobile C-band dual-Doppler network in a landfalling hurricane. This accomplishment marked the beginning of an era in which high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation and dual-Doppler wind data over mesoscale (?100 km) regions can be acquired from mobile ground-based platforms during extreme heavy rain and high-wind events. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for building the mobile observing systems, highlight some of the challenges that were encountered in creating a unique multia-gency coalition, provide examples of how the SMART radars have contributed to research and education, and discuss future plans for continued development and management of the radar facility, including how others may use the radars for their own research and teaching programs. The capability of the SMART radars to measure winds in non-precipitating environments, to capture rapidly evolving, short-lived, small-scale tornadic circulations, and to sample mesoscale regions with high spatial resolution over broad regions of heavy rainfall is demonstrated. Repeated successful intercepts provide evidence that these radars are capable of being used to study a wide range of atmospheric phenomena.},

These flashes have extensive IC components as well as return strokes to ground but are misclassified as CG flashes in current flash type analyses due to the presence of a return stroke. In an effort to show that IC, CG, and hybrid flashes should be separately classified, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was applied to the flash sizes, flash initiation, and flash propagation altitudes for each of the three flash types. The KS test statistically showed that IC, CG, and hybrid flashes do not have the same parent distributions and thus should be separately classified. Separate classification of hybrid flashes will lead to improved lightning-related research, because unambiguously classified hybrid flashes occur on the same order of magnitude as CG flashes for multicellular storms.},

abstract = {On 21 April 2006 a mesoscale convective system (MCS) passed within range of the Houston (KHGX) operational Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D, S-band) and the Houston Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) network, which measures the time and three-dimensional location of total, or both intracloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG), lightning. This study documents the evolution of total lightning and radar reflectivity for the 21 April 2006 MCS over Texas, with emphasis on the stratiform region and those processes in the convection region that likely influence stratiform region development. As the MCS traverses the LDAR network, the system slowly matures with a weakening convective line and a developing stratiform region and radar bright band. The area of stratiform precipitation increases by an order of magnitude and mean stratiform radar reflectivity increases by 7-8 dB in the radar bright band and mixed-phase zone (0° to - 10 °C) just above it. As the stratiform region matures, the total lightning pathway slopes rearward and downward from the back of the convective line and into the stratiform region. At early times, the pathway extends horizontally rearward 40 to 50 km into the stratiform region at an altitude of 10 to 12 km. Near the end of the analysis time period, the total lightning pathway slopes rearward 40 km and downward 6 km through the transition zone before extending 40 to 50 km in the stratiform region at an altitude of 5 to 7 km. The sloping pathway likely results from charged ice particles advected from the convective line by storm relative front to rear flow while the level pathway extending further into the stratiform region is likely caused by both charge advection and local in-situ charging. As the stratiform region matures, the stratiform region total lightning flash rate increases and total lightning heights decrease. The percentage of stratiform total lightning flashes originating in the stratiform region increases significantly from 10% to 45%. The number of positive CG flashes in the stratiform region also increases with 73% originating in the convective or transition regions. Both in-situ charging mechanisms created by the development of the mesoscale updraft and charge advection by the front to rear flow likely contribute to the increased electrification and total lightning production of the stratiform region. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most of the adverse weather phenomena in Catalonia (northeast Iberian Peninsula) are caused by convective events, which can produce heavy rains, large hailstones, strong winds, lightning and/or tornadoes. These thunderstorms usually have marked paths. However, their trajectories can vary sharply at any given time, completely changing direction from the path they have previously followed. Furthermore, some thunderstorms split or merge with each other, creating new formations with different behaviour. In order to identify the potentially anomalous movements that some thunderstorms make, this paper presents a two-step methodology using a database with 8 years of daily rainfall fields data for the Catalonia region (2008–2015). First, it classifies daily rainfall fields between days with “no rain”, “non-potentially convective rain” and “potentially convective rain”, based on daily accumulated precipitation and extension thresholds. Second, it categorises convective structures within rainfall fields and briefly identifies their main features, distinguishing whether there were any anomalous thunderstorm movements in each case. This methodology has been applied to the 2008–2015 period, and the main climatic features of convective and non-convective days were obtained. The methodology can be exported to other regions that do not have the necessary radar-based algorithms to detect convective cells, but where there is a good rain gauge network in place.},

abstract = {Aerosol radiative forcing is a critical, though variable and uncertain, component of the global climate. Yet climate models rely on sparse information of the aerosol optical properties. In situ measurements, though important in many respects, seldom provide measurements of the undisturbed aerosol in the entire atmospheric column. Here, 8 yr of worldwide distributed data from the AERONET network of ground-based radiometers were used to remotely sense the aerosol absorption and other optical properties in several key locations. Estab- lished procedures for maintaining and calibrating the global network of radiometers, cloud screening, and inversion techniques allow for a consistent retrieval of the optical properties of aerosol in locations with varying emission sources and conditions. The multiyear, multi-instrument observations show robust differentiation in both the magnitude and spectral dependence of the absorption—a property driving aerosol climate forcing, for desert dust, biomass burning, urban–industrial, and marine aerosols. Moreover, significant variability of the absorption for the same aerosol type appearing due to different meteorological and source characteristics as well as different emission characteristics are observed. It is expected that this aerosol characterization will help refine aerosol optical models and reduce uncertainties in satellite observations of the global aerosol and in modeling aerosol impacts on climate.},

abstract = {The Southeast Queensland (SEQ) region of Australia is recognised for frequent thunderstorms documented through numerous studies including high impact severe thunderstorm cases which have caused insured losses exceeding $1 billion AUD. Despite a modest body of scientific literature, basic questions regarding the role of climate, synoptic and local-scale (<10 km) processes affecting the variability of thunderstorms still remain. In an effort to advance these questions as part of the Coastal Convective Interactions Experiment (CCIE), this study integrates multiple datasets across an 18-year period (July 1997 – June 2015) to provide a mesoscale climatological analysis of the SEQ hailstorms and associated environmental conditions. On a multi-year time scale, the relationship between the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation and hailstorm frequency is consistent with previous studies. On synoptic scales, a southeasterly change situation coupled with a sea breeze was found to provide the most favourable environment for hailstorms, particularly for southwest SEQ. On the local-scale, hail development within convective cells was found to be most frequent within the inland limb of maritime air mass on sea breeze days. This observation suggests the sea breeze air masses may become favourable for convection after sufficient modification during inland propagation.},

To accomplish this study, the available data regarding 9 (WW) present weather codes that reveal the hailstorm phenomenon with different intensities in 3 hrs observations for 6 meteorological stations of Tehran and vicinity for the period between 1985-2015 are applied. It is revealed that hail occurrence in Tehran is at its maximum in transition seasons of spring and fall between the hrs. 6 - 18 (UTC). It is found that the instability indexes intensify in the afternoon with a higher atmospheric flotation indicative of the possibility in occurrence of thunder hailstorm. Synoptic assessments point to the fact that the synoptic pattern created this thunder storm due to expansion of two: low-pressure cores over Arabia and North-Europe and the cold high-pressure over South Russia with a NS orientation have developed an intense pressure gradient over Tehran province. The study area being located at the left exit of sub-tropical jet stream has made a Baroclinic atmosphere condition on Tehran province. Access to great humidity resources of Mediterranean and Black seas and a drastic decrease of temperature at the upper level of the cloud verifies the hail occurrence on March 30th of 2015 in Tehran.},

This is the case in the analysis of Doppler On Wheels (DOW) mobile Doppler radar (MDR) data where the goal is to detect rapidly evolving coherent storm structures that reflect the complex interplay of non-linear dynamical processes. Estimating and quantifying such structures from the noisy and relatively sparsely sampled MDR data poses a difficult inverse problem for which traditional analysis methods such as expert and subjective pattern recognition, thresholding and contouring choices can be difficult. In this paper we investigate the application of a recently developed objective method for the analysis of spatio-temporal data called the entropy field decomposition (EFD) to the problem of the analysis of MDR data in tornadic supercells.

abstract = {A model is developed for the marine atmospheric surface layer including the interfacial sublayers on both sides of the air-sea interface where molecular constraints on transports are important. Flux-profile relations which are based on the postulation of intermittent renewal of the surface fluid aye matched to the logarithmic profiles and compared with both field and laboratory measurements. These relations enable numerical determination of air-sea exchanges of momentum, heat and water vapor (or bulk transfer coefficients) employing the bulk parameters of mean wind speed, temperature and humidity at a certain height in the atmospheric surface layer, and the water temperature.With increasing wind speed, the flow goes from smooth to rough and the bulk transfer coefficient for momentum also increases. The increase in roughness is associated with increasing wave height which in the present model results in sheltering at the wave troughs. Due to the decrease in turbulent transports, the transfer coefficients of heat and water vapor decrease slightly with wind speed after the wind speed exceeds a certain value. The bulk transfer coefficients are also found to decrease with increasing stability. If the `bucket temperature' which typically gives the water temperature a few centimeters below the surface is used, rather than the interfacial temperature, erroneous results may be obtained when the air-sea temperature difference is small.By including the effects of stability and interfacial conditions in bulk parameterization, the model provides a way to account for physical conditions which are known to affect air-sea exchanges.},

abstract = {The concentration of hail damage over a very few days of each warm season is a main characteristic of hail climatology in Southwestern France. The hailpad networks set up there in 1988 by the ANELFA hail prevention project have allowed the development of a new extreme hail day climatology which consists in examining the hail day data in the Atlantic region mainly under maritime conditions, and in the Pyrenean region, under continental and mountain influences. A pyramidal representation of each daily mean hailfall parameter (frequency per station, kinetic energy per hailfall, and kinetic energy per station), ranked by order of magnitude, allows a comparison of the mean and extreme values in the two regions, and reveals the strongest hail days in each one. During the 23-year period under study, 13 extreme situations (7 in the Atlantic region, 6 in the Pyrenean one) are highlighted, keeping the first three day ranking for each parameter. For each day, the synoptic situation, cell type, storm trajectories, and hail damages are examined, and numerical simulations with the WRF model, initialized by the CDAS/NCEP-NCAR reanalysis program, are considered. The study confirms that the Pyrenean region (20,000km2) has experienced the major hail situations, with record values of each parameter for the two regions. On the frequency record day (16 April 2007), 17% of the hailpad stations were impacted, and on the kinetic energy record day (16 July 2009), the total hailstone energy reached 33J/m2 per station. Two main types of synoptic situations have been identified according to the location of the pressure low generating the upper level flow, either near Portugal or near Ireland. A third type, with the pressure low above the Mediterranean, has been observed only once. The WRF-NMM simulations show that all the severe hailstorms that occurred in the twelve situations (one situation is common to both regions) developed in the areas where the mesoscale environment was characterized by a strong dynamical forcing and by high values of the low-level and deep shears. After calibration with this sample of extreme hail days, the WRF model appears promising for severe hail forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Observations have also been obtained of a distinct type of energetic discharge referred to as positive bipolar breakdown, recently identified as the source of trans-ionospheric pulse pairs (TIPPs) observed by satellites from space. The bipolar breakdown has been confirmed to occur between the main negative and upper positive charge regions of a storm and found to be the initial event of otherwise normal intracloud discharges. The latter is contrary to previous findings that the breakdown appeared to be temporally isolated from other lightning in a storm. Peak VHF radiation from the energetic discharges is observed to be typically 30 dB stronger than that from other lightning processes and to correspond to source power in excess of 100 kW over a 6 MHz bandwidth centered at 63 MHz.},

abstract = {The representation of deep convection in general circulation models is in part informed by cloud-resolving models (CRMs) that function at higher spatial and temporal resolution; however, recent studies have shown that CRMs often fail at capturing the details of deep convection updrafts. With the goal of providing constraint on CRM simulation of deep convection updrafts, ground-based remote sensing observations are analyzed and statistically correlated for four deep convection events observed during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E). Since positive values of specific differential phase KDP observed above the melting level are associated with deep convection updraft cells, so-called KDP columns are analyzed using two scanning polarimetric radars in Oklahoma: the National Weather Service Vance WSR- 88D (KVNX) and the Department of Energy C-band Scanning Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Precipitation Radar (C-SAPR). KVNX and C-SAPR KDP volumes and columns are then statistically correlated with vertical winds retrieved via multi-Doppler wind analysis, lightning flash activity derived from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array, and KVNX differential reflectivity ZDR. Results indicate strong correlations of KDP volume above the melting level with updraft mass flux, lightning flash activity, and intense rainfall. Analysis of KDP columns reveals signatures of changing updraft properties from one storm event to another as well as during event evolution. Comparison of ZDR to KDP shows commonalities in information content of each, as well as potential problems with ZDR associated with observational artifacts.},

abstract = {Charge separation during rebounding collisions of ice crystals on hail particles is a probable mechanism of thunderstorm electrification. Modelling of laboratory results successfully predicts the charge structure in thunderclouds under most conditions. An exception is the intense positive ground flashes observed in mid-continental severe storms which contain large hailstones that are generally in wet growth. It is difficult to see how interacting ice crystals may separate from the wet surface of a hailstone without sticking, although some studies have reported charge separation during this process. Our laboratory experiments show that, during ice crystal interactions with a simulated hailstone in wet growth, a small but significant charge transfer occurs during ice crystal interactions. We present evidence to show that the hailstone surface is not uniformly wet and consists of dry zones, particularly at the edges, where ice crystals are most likely to impact, and hypothesize that a small number of ice crystals rebounding off these zones may give rise to the observed charging current. While this may explain wet growth charging in laboratory experiments, we cannot directly extend the findings to natural thunderstorms where hailstones tend to rotate and gyrate as they fall, but they may experience different growth regimes within the cloud.},

The storm occurred on 16 May 2010 and produced a swath of extremely damaging hail across a large portion of the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metro area. Hail sizes over 10 cm in diameter and hail drifts upward of 1.5 m in height were reported. Both S-band (KOUN) and C-band [University of Oklahoma Polarimetric Radar for Innovations in Meteorology and Engineering (OU-PRIME)] polarimetric radars in Norman, Oklahoma, sampled the storm at ranges less than 60 km, so that high-resolution dual-wavelength polarimetric data were obtained.

abstract = {A radar wind profiler (RWP) dataset collected during the two-year DOE ARM Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5) campaign is used to estimate convective cloud vertical velocity, area fraction and mass flux profiles. Vertical velocity observations are presented using cumulative frequency histograms and weighted-mean profiles to provide insights in a manner suitable for GCM-model scale comparisons (spatial domains from 20 km to 60 km). Convective profile sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions and seasonal regime controls is also considered.Aggregate and ensemble average vertical velocity, convective area fraction and mass flux profiles, as well as magnitudes and relative profile behaviors, are found consistent with previous studies. Updrafts and downdrafts increase in magnitude with height to mid-levels (6 to 10 km), with updraft area also increasing with height. Updraft mass flux profiles similarly increase with height, showing a peak in magnitude near 8 km. Downdrafts are observed to be most frequent below the freezing level, with downdraft area monotonically decreasing with height. Updraft and downdraft profile behaviors are further stratified according to environmental controls. These results indicate stronger vertical velocity profile behaviors under higher CAPE and lower low-level moisture conditions. Sharp contrasts in convective area fraction and mass flux profiles are most pronounced when retrievals are segregated according to Amazonian wet and dry season conditions. During this deployment, wet season regimes favored higher domain mass flux profiles, attributed to more frequent convection that offsets weaker average convective cell vertical velocities.},

abstract = {Nowcasting of convection in the mountains is a challenging task because of the additional difficulties caused by the complex orography. In the Alpine region even relatively small but intense thunderstorms can produce local flash floods causing severe consequences (e.g. canyoning accidents, landslides) and damages. In densely populated areas the complex terrain requires thus the tracking and monitoring of individual, even relatively small thunderstorms. Moreover in the pre-Alpine and plateau region convective cells can organize at the meso-beta scale and must also be considered. In the Alpine region the use of expert systems is limited by the restricted availability of some of the required input data (e.g. radar beam blocked at low altitudes not allowing the detection of convergence lines, Roberts and Rutledge (2003)). Since convective storms are still difficult to predict by operational numerical models, national weather services often use automatic systems based on the analysis of present weather and the extrapolation of already initiated phenomena. Operational nowcasting systems are mainly based on the use of radar echoes for the detection, tracking and extrapolation of precipitation events. An overview of actual convective storms nowcasting can be found in Wilson et al. (1998, 2004). MeteoSwiss and M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France cooperate on the development and evaluation of an automated radar echo detection and tracking method based on a dynamic thresholding scheme applied on composite images. MeteoSwiss has introduced the scheme in 2003 under the name TRT (Thunderstorms Radar Tracking) as a part of its nowcasting, warning and information system (Hering et al., 2004). The forecaster receives automated information in real-time about cells activity, which he can use as a decisionmaking aid for convection warning. M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France uses the scheme under the name CONO (Convection Nowcasting Objects), in SIGOONS (SIGnificant Weather Object-Oriented Nowcasting System; Brovelli et al., 2005, in this issue). The principle of the thresholding scheme is derived from the algorithms developed for the severe thunderstorms satellite nowcasting product RDT by M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France, within the framework of EUMETSAT's SAF Nowcasting. This product uses the infrared images of the 10.8 µm channel of geostationary satellites like Meteosat-8 to detect convective systems, from isolated cells up to mesoscale convective complexes (Morel et al., 2000, 2002). To make use of the satellite algorithms also for radar composite images, substantial modifications were required, mainly concerning the data input modules, the cell displacement velocity calculations, the clustering of cells, as well as the creation of a major post-processing of the output data. An overview of the main modifications necessary for the adaptation to radar data and a study of the algorithm parameters, such as the different reflectivity thresholds, as well as detailed description of the algorithms are given in Hering et al. (2004).},

abstract = {The vertical profiles of latent heat released to the atmosphere are distinctly different between the two basic modes (convective and stratiform) of precipitation. Triggered by climatological studies focused on the heating of the atmosphere, but also by aspects relevant for radar-rainfall measurement, hydrologic modeling, and parameterizing different types of rainfall in large-scale and global circulation models, the discussion of convective vs. stratiform rainfall has gained increased attention. In that light, the kinematic and microphysical aspects of precipitation formation are revisited and a conceptual model introduced that provides a basis for an improved understanding of differences observed in convective and stratiform rainfall. The existence of higher-density ice particles is indicative for a convective nature of precipitation. Graupel may be considered as particles marking the boundary between convective and stratiform precipitation. The growth of higher-density graupel particles requires updrafts of the order of 2-3 m/s, which is in support of classifications commonly advocated.},

abstract = {Despite the considerable damage potential related to severe hailstorms, knowledge about the local hail probability in Germany is very limited. Constructing a reliable hail probability map is challenging due largely to the lack of direct hail observations. In our study, we suggest a reasonable method by which to estimate hail signals from 3D radar reflectivity measured by conventional single-polarization radars between 2005 and 2011. Evaluating the radar-derived hail days with loss data from a building and an agricultural insurance company confirmed the reliability of the method and the results as expressed, for example, by a Heidke Skill Score HSS of 0.7.Overall, radar-derived hail days demonstrate very high spatial variability, which reflects the local-scale nature of deep moist convection. Nonetheless, systematic patterns related to climatic conditions and orography can also be observed. On the large scale, the number of hail days substantially increases from north to south, which may plausibly be explained by the higher thermal instability in the south. At regional and local scales, several hot spots with elevated hail frequency can be identified, in most cases downstream of the mountains. Several other characteristics including convective energy related to the events identified, differences in track lengths, and seasonal cycles are discussed.},

An analysis was made of the behavior of the three dimensional structure of radar reflectivity and lightning type Intra-cloud (IN) and Cloud-Solo (NS), based on two lightning detection networks installed in the region during the RAIN Project, in order to correlate the occurrence of severe weather to the evolution of cloud ascending current, precipitation formation and electrification of this storm. It was observed by the reflectivity of the FCTH Radar images that, at times, the SC showed high values of reflectivity, with over 70 dBZ and indicating the presence of hail within the system. Through the behavior of electrical discharges, it is also noted that these accompany the displacement and intensity of the updraft and through the lightning jump, it is possible to detect in advance whether if the storm is intensifying or not. If so, this storm could possibly become a severe weather and cause serious damage to society.},

Notaries are forced to adopt a competitive corporate strategy. This has brought new opportunities for the application of IT. This paper outlines the possibilities for IT to support a competitive corporate strategy. We will provide insight in the willingness of notaries to change their corporate strategy and to adopt IT. This can be contributive to the software vendors and other third parties targeting the notarial domain, as they can adjust their business strategy based on the results of this study. We will suggest a notarial strategy optimization method to transform generic corporate strategies into situational strategies, and assemble solutions into situational strategy advices. This method can be used to compose situational corporate strategy advices, and provides a solid starting point for further research on mixed corporate strategies and corporate strategy maturity.},

The radar was operated in a special "near-dwelling" mode over two video disdrometers (2DVD) located 15 km away. The polarimetric radar-based retrieval algorithms for the DSD parameters and rain rate were obtained from simulations using the 2DVD measurements of the DSD. A unique feature of this paper is the radarbased estimation of the spatial correlation functions of the two DSD parameters and rain rate that are used to estimate the "point-to-area" variance. A detailed error variance separation is performed, including the aforementioned point-to-area variance, along with variance components due to the retrieval algorithm error, radar measurement error, and disdrometer sampling error. The spatial decorrelation distance was found to be smallest for the R (4.5 km) and largest forD 0 (8.24 km). For log 10 (N W ), it was 7.22 km. The proportion of the variance of the difference between radar-based estimates and 2DVD measurements that could be explained by the aforementioned errors was 100%, 57%, and 73% for D 0 , log 10 (N W ), and R, respectively. The overall accuracy of the radar-based retrievals for the particular precipitation event quantified in terms of the fractional standard deviation were estimated to be 6.8%, 6%, and 21% forD 0 , log 10 (N W ), and R, respectively. The normalized bias was < 1%. These correspond to time resolution of $\sim$3 min and spatial resolution of $\sim$1.5 km. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Monitoring thunderstorms activity is an essential part of operational weather surveillance given their poten- tial hazards, including lightning, hail, heavy rainfall, strong winds or even tornadoes. This study has two main objec- tives: firstly, the description of a methodology, based on radar and total lightning data to characterise thunderstorms in real-time; secondly, the application of this methodology to 66 thunderstorms that affected Catalonia (NE Spain) in the summer of 2006. An object-oriented tracking procedure is employed, where different observation data types generate four different types of objects (radar 1-km CAPPI reflectiv- ity composites, radar reflectivity volumetric data, cloud-to- ground lightning data and intra-cloud lightning data). In the framework proposed, these objects are the building blocks of a higher level object, the thunderstorm. The methodology is demonstrated with a dataset of thun- derstorms whose main characteristics, along the complete life cycle of the convective structures (development, maturity and dissipation), are described statistically. The development and dissipation stages present similar durations inmost cases examined. On the contrary, the duration of the maturity phase is much more variable and related to the thunderstorm inten- sity, defined here in terms of lightning flash rate. Most of the activity of IC and CG flashes is registered in the maturity stage. In the development stage littleCGflashes are observed (2% to 5%), while for the dissipation phase is possible to ob- serve a few more CG flashes (10% to 15%). Additionally, a selection of thunderstorms is used to examine general life cy- cle patterns, obtained from the analysis of normalized (with respect to thunderstorm total duration and maximum value of variables considered) thunderstorm parameters. Among other findings, the study indicates that the normalized dura- tion of the three stages of thunderstorm life cycle is similar in most thunderstorms, with the longest duration corresponding to the maturity stage (approximately 80% of the total time).},

abstract = {This study is concerned with the characteristics of storms exhibiting an abrupt temporal increase in the total lightning flash rate [i.e., lightning jump (LJ)]. An automated storm tracking method is used to identify storm "clusters" and total lightning activity from three different lightning detection systems over Oklahoma, northern Alabama, and Washington, D.C. On average and for different employed thresholds, the clusters that encompass at least one LJ (LJ1) last longer and relate to higher maximum expected size of hail, vertical integrated liquid, and lightning flash rates (area normalized) than do the clusters without an LJ (LJ0). The respective mean radar-derived and lightning values for LJ1 (LJ0) clusters are 80 min (35 min), 14mm(8 mm), 25 kgm-2 (18 kgm-2), and 0.05 flash min-1km-2 (0.01 flash min-1km-2). Furthermore, the LJ1 clusters are also characterized by slower-decaying autocorrelation functions, a result that implies a less "random" behavior in the temporal flash rate evolution. In addition, the temporal occurrence of the last LJ provides an estimate of the time remaining to the storm's dissipation. Depending on the LJ strength (i.e., varying thresholds), these values typically range between 20 and 60 min, with stronger jumps indicating more time until storm decay. This study's results support the hypothesis that the LJ is a proxy for the storm's kinematic and microphysical state rather than a coincidental value.},

Several authors estimated different global flash rates using ground-based instruments, but it has been the satellite era that enabled us to monitor lightning thunderstorm activity on the time and place that lightning exactly occurs. Launched into space as a component of NASA s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, in November 1997, the Lighting Imaging Sensor is still operating. LIS detects total lightning from space in a low-earth orbit . LIS has collected lightning measurements for 13 years and here we present a fully revised and current total lightning climatology over the tropics. Our analysis includes the individual flash characteristics , composite climatological maps, and trends for the observed total lightning during these 13 years. We have identified differences in the energetics of the flashes and/or the optical scattering properties of the storms cells due to cell-relative variations in microphysics and kinematics . On the climatological total lightning maps we found a dependency on the scale of analysis in identifying the lightning maximums in the tropics. The analysis of total lightning trends observed by LIS from 1998 to 2010 in different temporal and spatial scales, showed no systematic trends in the median to lower-end of the distributions, but most places in the tropics presented a decrease in the highest total lightning flash rates .},

abstract = {On the basis of 180 storms which took place between 2004 and 2011 over the province of Mendoza (Argentina) near to the Andes Range at southern mid-latitudes, we consider those registered in the northern and central crop areas (oases). The regions affected by these storms are currently protected by an operational hail mitigation project. Differences with previously reported storms detected in the southern oasis are highlighted. Mendoza is a semiarid region situated roughly between 32S and 37S at the east of the highest Andes top. It forms a natural laboratory where different sources of gravity waves, mainly mountain waves, occur. In this work, we analyze the effects of flow over topography generating mountain waves and favoring deep convection. The joint occurrence of storms with hail production and mountain waves is determined from mesoscale numerical simulations, radar and radiosounding data. In particular, two case studies that properly represent diverse structures observed in the region are considered in detail. A continuous wavelet transform is applied to each variable and profile to detect the main oscillation modes present. Simulated temperature profiles are validated and compared with radiosounding data. Each first radar echo, time and location are determined. The necessary energy to lift a parcel to its level of free convection is tested from the Convective Available Potential Energy and Convection Inhibition. This last parameter is compared against the mountain waves' vertical kinetic energy. The time evolution and vertical structure of vertical velocity and equivalent potential temperature suggest in both cases that the detected mountain wave amplitudes are able to provide the necessary energy to lift the air parcel and trigger convection. A simple conceptual scheme linking the dynamical factors taking place before and during storm development is proposed.},

@article{Schultz2015,
abstract = {AbstractA detailed case study analysis of four thunderstorms is performed using polarimetric and multi-Doppler capabilities to provide specificity on the physical and dynamical drivers behind lightning jumps. The main differences between small increases in the total flash rate and a lightning jump are the increases in graupel mass and updraft volumes ≥10 m s?1 between the ?10° and ?40°C isotherms. Updraft volumes ≥10 m s?1 increased in magnitude at least 3?5 min in advance of the increase in both graupel mass and total flash rate. Updraft volumes ≥10 m s?1 are more robustly correlated to total flash rate than maximum updraft speed over a thunderstorm?s entire life cycle. However, peak updraft speeds increase prior to 8 of the 12 lightning jumps examined. Decreases in mean and median flash footprint size during increases in total lightning are observed in all four thunderstorms and are most notable during development stages within the most intense storms. However, this inverse relationship breaks down on larger storm scales as storms mature and anvils and stratiform regions developed with time. Promisingly, smaller flash sizes are still collocated with the strongest updraft speeds, while larger flash sizes are observed within weaker updraft regions. The results herein emphasize the following for lightning jump applications: both the lightning jump sigma level and the resultant magnitude of the total flash rate must be employed in conjunction to assess storm intensity using lightning data. The sigma-level magnitude of the lightning jump is the early warning that indicates that rapid intensification is occurring, while the magnitude of the total flash rate provides insight into the size and maintenance of the updraft volume and graupel mass. These cases serve as conceptual models for future applications of the lightning jump algorithm for hazardous weather monitoring.},

abstract = {A previous hypothesis advanced from observational studies such as METROMEX suggests that the intensity, frequency, and organization of cumulus convection may be impacted by the forcing of enhanced merger activity downstream of urban zones. A resulting corollary is that cities may exert an indirect anthropogenic "forcing" of parameters related to convection and associated phenomena such as lightning and precipitation. This paper investigates the urban-merger hypothesis by examining the role of convective cell mergers on the existence and persistence of the Houston lightning "anomaly", a local maximum in cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity documented to exist over and east of Houston.Using eight summer seasons of peak columnar radar reflectivity, CG lightning data and a cell-tracking algorithm, a two-dimensional cell merger climatology is created for portions of Eastern Texas and Louisiana. Results from the tracking and analysis of over 3.8 million cells indicate that merger-driven enhancements in convection induce a positive response (O 46%) in ground flash densities throughout the domain, with areas of enhanced lightning typically being co-located with areas of enhanced merger activity. However, while mergers over the Houston area (relative to elsewhere in the domain) do result in more vigorous convective cells that produce larger CG flash densities, we find that CG lightning contributions due to mergers are distributed similarly throughout the domain. Hence while we demonstrate that cell mergers do greatly impact the production of lightning, the urban cell merger hypothesis does not uniquely explain the presence of a local lightning maximum near and downstream of Houston. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

They hypothesize that precipitation interactions involved in reflectivity growth at the 7–9-km level of the updraft are involved in precipitation charging and electrification. They also hypothesize that the intense convection in the mesocyclone region elevates the lower negative charge of the storm closer to upper positive charge, thereby enhancing IC flash rates.

Compared to climatological values over eastern Colorado, the 2002 fire period showed enhancements in satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD; up to 0.4 units greater), and the percentage of +CG lightning more than doubled in the domain average. However, spatial patterns were different in the fire's vicinity, with increases in AOD but not in +CGs. Denver soundings during the fire were compared to climatology, and showed environmental differences that are associated with increased +CG percentage, in particular higher cloud base and reduced warm-cloud depth. Thus, our findings provide only mixed support for the idea that smoke aerosols impact CG polarity, and suggest a possible link between drought conditions and increased +CG percentage.},

abstract = {A non-hydrostatic, fully compressible, regional-scale numerical model of the atmosphere that includes parameterization of cloud microphysics is run in a two-dimensional mode. It uses two different observed vertical profiles of temperature, relative humidity and wind to simulate the local circulation evolution and impact on convection and nocturnal fog occurrence in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. The atmospheric behaviour generated by the model is similar to the observations of the two summer days with and without sea breeze progression over the plateau. The convective development occurs in the afternoon of the two experiments but with different features and intensities. In the experiment with sea-breeze progression, there is fog formation over the plateau during the following night, in accordance with the observations. A strong northwesterly flow acting in the lower troposphere, with intensity varying between 7 and 10 m s 1 , appears as an inhibiting agent of the sea-breeze progression over the plateau and of convective development in the afternoon and of the nocturnal fog occurrence. In this case, observed gusts during the night are well simulated and appear to be related to the topography.},

abstract = {The effect of solar variability parameters (solar flux (F10.7cm), cosmic ray flux, sunspot numbers) and meteorological parameters on convective rainfall and lightning flashes in four different Indian regions of equal area is studied. Regions are selected having different topological, vegetation, proximity with ocean and habitat features. Solar variability shows statistically insignificant effect on lightning flash and convective rainfall. The seasonal variation of lightning flashes and convective rainfall in each region could be explained considering the variation of CAPE and surface temperature in that region. The dependence of lightning flashes and convective rainfall on meteorological parameters varies from region to region, as is evident from correlation studies. Lightning flashes is well correlated (R=0.81) with CAPE in region R1and barely correlated (R=0.23, 0.24) in region R3and R4whereas rainfall is well correlated (R>0.68) in all the regions. Lightning flashes are better correlated (R>0.57) with temperature in R1, R2and R4and moderately correlated in R3(R=0.44). Rainfall in R3is very well correlated (R=0.91) with surface temperature and there is insignificant correlation in R1(R=0.09). There is very good positive correlation (R>0.59) between cloud cover and convective rainfall in the entire region and well negative correlation (-0.83<R<-0.61) between OLR and convective rainfall. OLR and cloud cover show little impact on lightning flashes. Lightning flashes and convective rainfall show average positive correlation (0.48<R<0.53). Aerosol concentration is the largest in region R4and showed an increasing trend between 2007 and 2011. Lightning flashes and convective rainfall are positively correlated (0.10<R<0.58) with aerosol concentration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Two events from two different regions (Greeley, Colorado, and Huntsville, Alabama) are analyzed. While the MPS, with its 50-$\mu$m resolution, enabled measurements of small drops, typically for drop diameters below about 1.1 mm, the 2DVD provided accurate measurements for drop diameters above 0.7 mm. Drop concentrations in the 0.7–1.1-mm overlap region were found to be in excellent agreement between the two instruments. Examination of the combined spectra clearly reveals a drizzle mode and a precipitation mode. The combined spectra were analyzed in terms of the DSD parameters, namely, the normalized intercept parameter NW, the mass-weighted mean diameter Dm, and the standard deviation of mass spectrum $\sigma$M. The inclusion of small drops significantly affected the NW and the ratio $\sigma$M/Dm toward higher values relative to u...},

abstract = {A thunderstorm that developed over northeastern Spain on 16 June 2006 is analyzed. This severe thunderstorm produced hailstones as large as 40 mm and had a lifetime of 3 h and 30 min. Radar cross-sections show strong vertical development with cloud echo tops reaching an altitude of 13 km. The specific characteristics of the lightning activity of this storm were: (i) a large amount (81%) of negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) flashes with very low peak currents (< 10 kA in absolute value), (ii) a very large proportion of intra-cloud (IC) flashes with an IC/CG ratio reaching about 400, (iii) a large number of "short" IC flashes (with only 1-VHF source according to SAFIR detection), (iv) a large increase of the -CG flash rate and of the CG proportion near the end of the storm. The rate of -CG flashes with a low peak current were observed to evolve similarly to the rates of IC flashes. Most of them have been assumed to be IC flashes misclassified by the Spanish Lightning Detection Network (SLDN). They have been filtered as it is usually done for misclassified +CG flashes. After this filtering, CG flash rates remained very low (< 1 min- 1) with +CG flashes sometimes dominant. All the particular lightning activity characteristics similar to those observed in the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study (STEPS) campaigns support the hypothesis that this thunderstorm could have had an inverted-polarity or complex charge structure. The maximum IC flash rate (67 min- 1) peaked 24 min before the presence of reflectivity higher than 60 dBZ. The IC activity abruptly decreased during the period when reflectivity was dramatically increasing. The time of maximum reflectivity observed by radar was consistent with the times of reported hail at the ground. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {A hailpad network, intended to draw up a large-scale, long-term physical climatology of hailfalls, is being installed in southwestern France, one of the severely hailed regions in the world. The first five years of operation of this network have enabled the organization of a suitable standardization of the data. The classical exponential form is well adapted to represent the mean size distribution of the hailstones sampled at several locations, but we suggest the replacement of the usual concentration parameter of this form-the number of zero diameter hailstones-by the number of the smallest hailstones really counted on the pads, so as not to amplify, with the regression, a relationship between this parameter and the slope parameter. There is a significant correlation between the concentration parameter and the altitude of the 0°C isotherm level, and a regression enables the determination of a concentration parameter at the 0°C level. By contrast, the correlation between the slope parameter and the altitude of the 0°C level is weak. When these results are compared with Ludlam's model of hailstone melting, they suggest that hail mainly falls within downdrafts. With the limited amount of data presently available, no correlation appears between the distribution parameters and the storm thermodynamics, but the concentration parameter is larger while the slope parameter is smaller in the frontal storms than in the intramass ones, a result explaining why the most severe hailstorms of southwestern France are frontal. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Abstract. This is study provides an overview of precipitation processes and their sensitivities to environmental conditions, in the Central Amazon Basin, during the GoAmazon2014/5 and ACRIDICON-CHUVA experiments. Taking advantage of the numerous measuring platforms and instruments systems operating during both campaigns sampling cloud structure and environmental conditions during 2014 and 2015, the rainfall variability among seasons, aerosol loading, land surface type, and topography have carefully been characterized. Differences between the wet and dry seasons were examined from a variety of different perspectives. The rain rate distribution, the total amount of rainfall, and the raindrop size distribution (the mean mass-weighted diameter) were quantified for the two seasons. The dry season has a higher average rain rate than the wet season and reflects more intense rain. While the cumulative wet season rainfall amount was four times larger than the total dry season rainfall, reflecting in large total rainfall accumulation. The typical size and life cycle of the Amazon cloud clusters (observed by satellite) and rain cells (observed by radar) were examined, as well their differences among the seasons. Moreover, we analyse the monthly mean thermodynamical and dynamical variables, measured by radiosondes to elucidate the differences in rainfall characteristics during the wet and dry seasons. The sensitivity of rainfall to the atmospheric aerosol loading is discussed with regard to the mean mass-weighted diameter and rain rate. This topic was evaluated during the wet season only due to the insignificant statistics of rainfall events for different ranges of aerosol loadings and the low frequency of precipitation events during the dry season. The aerosol impacts on the cloud droplet diameter is different for small and large drops. For the wet season, we observe no dependence on land surface type on the rain rate. However, during the dry season, urban areas exhibit the largest rain rate tail distribution, and deforested regions have the lowest mean rain rate. Airplane measurements were performed to characterize and contrast cloud microphysical properties and processes over forested and deforested regions. The vertical motion turned out to be uncorrelated with cloud droplet sizes, but the cloud droplets number concentration revealed a linear relationship to the vertical motion. Clouds over forest exhibit larger droplets than clouds over pastures at all cloud levels. Finally, the connections between topography and rain rate were evaluated, showing a higher rain rate over higher elevations for the dry season.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.This paper analyzes the cloud microphysics in different layers of storms as a function of three-dimensional total lightning density. A mobile X-band polarimetric radar and very high frequency (VHF) sources from Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) observations during the 2011/2012 Brazil spring-summer were used to determine the microphysical signatures of radar vertical profiles and lightning density. This study quantified the behavior of 5.3 million vertical profiles of the horizontal reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), specific differential phase (KDP), and correlation coefficient ($\rho$HV). The principal changes in the polarimetric variables occurred only for VHF source rate density greater than 14 VHF sources per km2 in 4 min. These storms showed an enhanced positive KDP in the mixed 1 layer (from 0 to −15°C) probably associated with supercooled liquid water signatures, whereas regions with negative ZDR and KDP and moderate ZH in the mixed 2 layer (from −15 to −40°C) were possibly associated with the presence of conical graupel. The glaciated (above −40°C) and upper part of the mixed 2 layers showed a significant trend to negative KDP with an increase in lightning density, in agreement with vertical alignment of ice particle by the cloud electric field. A conceptual model that presents the microphysical signatures in storms with and without lightning activity was constructed. The observations documented in this study provide an understanding of how the combinations of polarimetric variables could help to identify storms with different lightning density and vice versa.},

In Italy, only few regions have a network for monitoring hail events, the coverage of these networks is limited to small areas, and long-term and nationwide time series of hail events are not available, therefore the chances of improving the quality of the hail forecast are severely reduced.The aim of the present study is to collect data and information from different sources on hailstorms in order to evaluate the annual hailstorm frequency in Italy. In order to obtain more complete information about the hail distribution, different datasets have been used: i) daily information about hailstorm occurrence at fixed meteorological stations from the NCDC dataset; ii) events information (date, location, and hailstone size) obtained using hailstorm reports available from different agencies. In this study the hail events are classified according to the hailstone size, then a statistical approach is used in order to evaluate the mean annual frequency of the events at the municipality scale for each hailstone size class. The atmospheric parameters, known as hailstorm precursors, are estimated using the NCEP/NCAR daily reanalysis at 2.5. degree horizontal resolution.As a final result, this study presents a step forward towards a climatology of hail frequency in Italy at municipality scale for the period 1971-2009. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The MCSs formed in different meteorological regimes, based on profiles of atmospheric wind and thermodynamic data. The radar analyses show that the MCSs were distinct in terms of kinematic and microphysical characteristics. These observations suggest that the easterly and westerly wind regimes in the southwest Amazon region produce convection with different vertical structure characteristics, similar to regimes elsewhere in the global tropics (e.g., Maritime Continent).},

Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection. Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75% of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90% in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database.},

The study's goal was to analyze the time evolution of infrared satellite fields and ground-based polarimetric radar during NAMMA to quantify relationships between satellite and radar observations for lightning and nonlightning convective clouds over equatorial Africa. Using NPOL data, very low-frequency arrival time difference lightning data, andMSGSpinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager observations, the physical attributes of growing cumulus clouds, including ice mass production, updraft strength, cloud depth, and cloud-top glaciation were examined. It was found that, on average, the lightning storms had stronger updrafts (seen in the satellite and radar fields), which lead to the formation of deeper clouds (seen in the satellite and radar fields) and subsequently much more ice in the mixed-phase region (as confirmed in radar observations), as well as much more nonprecipitating ice in the top 1 km of the cloud (as quantified in both satellite and radar fields) than the nonlightning storms. Computed radar-derived ice masses in cumulus clouds verifies the traditional MSG indicators of cloud-top glaciation, while NPOL verifies internal structures (i.e., large amounts of graupel) where satellite and radar show strong updrafts.},

A rather large number of cloud-resolving simulations were performed which explored the parameter space varying both potential CCN concentration and cloud base heights, using a microphysical scheme that predicts 3-moments of the hail size distribution. Several simulated quantities exhibited distinct responses to enhanced CCN concentrations depending on the cloud base altitudes. For instance, positive changes prevailed in the number concentration and the predominant diameter of hailstones on the surface, the integral mass of hail precipitation and the peak rates for high cloud base heights or a deeper layer between cloud base and the freezing level. Conversely, weak effects prevailed for numerical experiments initialized with lower cloud bases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Present and past weather reports from ∼15 000 stations around the globe and from the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set from 1975 to 1997 were analyzed for the frequency of occurrence for and the percentage of the days with various types of precipitation (drizzle, nondrizzle, showery, nonshowery, and snow) and thunderstorms. In this paper, the mean geographical, seasonal, and interannual variations in the frequencies are documented. Drizzles occur most frequently (∼5%–15% of the time) over mid- and high-latitude oceans. Nonshowery precipitation is the preferred form of precipitation over the storm-track regions at northern mid- and high latitudes in boreal winter and over the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in all seasons. Showery precipitation occurs ∼5%–20% of the time over the oceans, as compared with < 10% over land areas except in boreal summer over Northern Hemisphere land areas, where showery precipitation and thunderstorms occur in over 20% of the days. Inferred mean precipitation intensity is generally < 1.0 mm h−1 at mid- and high latitudes and ∼1.5–3.0 mm h−1 in the Tropics. The intertropical convergence zone and the South Pacific convergence zone are clearly defined in the frequency maps but not in the intensity maps. Nonshowery precipitation at low latitudes is associated with showery precipitation, consistent with observations of stratiform precipitation accompanying mesoscale convective systems in the Tropics. The seasonal cycles of the showery precipitation and thunderstorm frequencies exhibit a coherent land–ocean pattern in that land areas peak in summer and the oceans peak in winter. The leading EOFs in the nondrizzle and nonshowery precipitation frequencies are an ENSO-related mode that confirms the ENSO-induced precipitation anomalies over the open oceans previously derived from satellite estimates.},

Previous CHMI studies identified two methods of radar echo prediction, which were then implemented during 2003 into the Czech weather radar network operational weather processor. The applications put into operations were the Continuity Tracking Radar Echoes by Correlation (COTREC) algorithm, and an application that predicts future radar fields using the wind field derived from the geopotential at 700 hPa calculated from a local numerical weather prediction model (ALADIN). To ensure timely delivery of the prediction products to the users, the forecasts are implemented into a web-based viewer (JSMeteoView) that has been developed by the CHMI Radar Department. At present, this viewer is used by all CHMI forecast offices for versatile visualization of radar and other meteorological data (Meteosat, lightning detection, NWP LAM output, SYNOP data) in the Internet/Intranet environment, and the viewer has detailed geographical navigation capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike most other types of storms in which positive ground flashes occur, severe storms can have positive flash rates and densities of strike points comparable to those usually observed for negative ground flashes in active thunderstorms. Fifteen such storms are analyzed in this paper to examine relationships of positive ground flashes to various storm characteristics, especially reports of large hail and tornadoes. In 4 of the 15 storms, ground flash activity was dominated by positive cloud-to-ground lightning throughout most of the life of the storm. In 11 storms, the dominant polarity of ground flashes switched from positive to negative sometime during the mature stage of the storm. In all cases observed by Doppler radar, storms dominated by positive flashes had at least some rotation, and in most case...},

Using data from nearly one billion detected sources of various powers, an approximation of VHF source detection efficiency (relative to the number of sources detected within 25km of the center of the array) for the Oklahoma LMA is calculated for different ranges and source powers. The calculated source detection efficiencies are then used to normalize the VHF source data out to a range of 125 km, as a method of correcting the detection efficiency drop-off with range. The data is also sorted into flashes using a popular flash-sorting algorithm in order to compare how well flash-sorting corrects for detection-efficiency drop-off with range compared to the normalization method.

This study describes the production of dual-Doppler wind analyses from several case studies using data from a rapid-scan, X-band, polarimetric, Doppler radar – the RaXPol radar – and data from nearby WSR-88D radars. Of particular interest is mitigating difficulties related to the drastic differences in scanning rates of the two radars. To account for differences in temporal resolution, a variational reflectivity tracking scheme (a spatially variable advection correction technique; SVAC) has been employed to interpolate (in a Lagrangian sense) the coarser temporal resolution data (WSR-88D) to the times of the RaXPol volume scans. The RaXPol data and temporally interpolated WSR-88D data are then used to create quasi-rapid-scan dual-Doppler analyses.

This study concentrates on the tail of the DSD, which largely impacts rainfall retrieval algorithms that utilize radar reflectivity. The maximum raindrop diameter was a median factor of 1.8 larger than the mass-weighted mean diameter and increased with rainfall rate. Only 0.4% of the 1-min DSD spectra were found to contain large raindrops exceeding 5 mm in diameter. Large raindrops were most abundant at the tropical locations, especially in Puerto Rico, and were largely concentrated during the spring, especially at subtropical locations. Giant raindrops exceeding 8 mm in diameter occurred at tropical, subtropical, and high-latitude continental locations. The greatest numbers of giant raindrops were found in the subtropical locations, with the largest being a 9.7-mm raindrop that occurred in northern Oklahoma during the passage of a hail-producing thunderstorm. These results suggest large raindrops are more likely to fall from clouds that contain hail, especially those raindrops exceeding 8 mm in diameter.},

abstract = {AbstractMost of the recent hydrometeor classification schemes are based on fuzzy logic. When the input radar observations are noisy, the output classification could also be noisy, since the process is bin based and the information from neighboring radar cells is not considered. This paper employs cluster analysis, in combination with fuzzy logic, to improve the hydrometeor classification from dual-polarization radars using a multistep approach. The first step involves a radar-based optimization of an input temperature profile from auxiliary data. Then a first-guess fuzzy logic processing produces the classification to initiate a cluster analysis with contiguity and penalty constraints. The result of the cluster analysis is eventually processed to identify the regions populated with adjacent bins assigned to the same hydrometeor class. Finally, the set of connected regions is passed to the fuzzy logic algorithm for the final classification, exploiting the statistical sample composed by the distribution of the dual-polarization and temperature observations within the regions. Example applications to radar in different environments and meteorological situations, and using different operating frequency bands?namely, S, C, and X bands?are shown. The results are discussed with specific attention to the robustness of the method and the segregation of the data space. Furthermore, the sensitivity to noise and bias in the input variables is also analyzed.},

abstract = {Abstract Dual-Doppler (S-band) radar observations are used to describe both the three-dimensional flow and a fife cycle of a severe thunderstorm on 6 June 1974. The primary updraft region was near a small mesocyclonic circulation located on the storm's right (southern) flank. Rotation was first noted aloft (between 3 and 5 km elevation) and lowered with time. During the mature stage, major downdrafts were found on the storm's western edge and within the left forward (northeastern) quadrant. Outflow from both downdrafts combined near the cloud base to form a vigorous gust front. Hook echo formation is attributed to horizontal acceleration of low-level droplet-laden air as the downdrafts intensified and the outflow interacted with the inward-spiraling updraft.},

abstract = {This work proposes a new method for hail precipitation detection and probability, based on single-polarization X-band radar measurements. Using a dataset consisting of reflectivity volumes, ground truth observations and atmospheric sounding data, a probability of hail index, which provides a simple estimate of the hail potential, has been trained and adapted within Naples metropolitan environment study area. The probability of hail has been calculated starting by four different hail detection methods. The first two, based on (1) reflectivity data and temperature measurements and (2) on vertically-integrated liquid density product, respectively, have been selected from the available literature. The other two techniques are based on combined criteria of the above mentioned methods: the first one (3) is based on the linear discriminant analysis, whereas the other one (4) relies on the fuzzy-logic approach. The latter is an innovative criterion based on a fuzzyfication step performed through ramp membership functions. The performances of the four methods have been tested using an independent dataset: the results highlight that the fuzzy-oriented combined method performs slightly better in terms of false alarm ratio, critical success index and area under the relative operating characteristic. An example of application of the proposed hail detection and probability products is also presented for a relevant hail event, occurred on 21 July 2014.},

abstract = {Accurate storm identification and tracking are basic and essential parts of radar and severe weather warning operations in today's operational meteorological community. Improvements over the original WSR-88D storm series algorithm have been made with the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking algorithm (SCIT). This paper discusses the SCIT algorithm, a centroid tracking algorithm with improved methods of identifying storms (both isolated and clustered or line storms). In an analysis of 6561 storm cells, the SCIT algorithm correctly identified 68% of all cells with maximum reflectivities over 40 dBZ and 96% of all cells with maximum reflectivities of 50 dBZ or greater. The WSR-88D storm series algorithm performed at 24% and 41%, respectively, for the same dataset. With better identification performance, the potential exists for better and more accurate tracking information. The SCIT algorithm tracked greater than 90% of all storm cells correctly. The algorithm techniques and results of a detailed performance evaluation are presented. This algorithm was included in the WSR-88D Build 9.0 of the Radar Products Generator software during late 1996 and early 1997. It is hoped that this paper will give new users of the algorithm sufficient background information to use the algorithm with confidence.},

First, the variations of droplet size distribution (DSD) and liquid water content (LWC) in vertical and streamwise directions were measured. Then, variations of ice accretion on an angle bar in the same direction as the flow were measured to determine the aerodynamic forces on a tower leg as a function of ice accretion. The ice accretion experiments were carried out under two conditions with different LWCs and air velocities. The drag coefficient was calculated with different masses and ice shapes for the angle bar as obtained in the experiments. The results showed a reduction in the drag coefficient in the vertical direction with increased local LWC and thicker ice accumulation.{\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {AbstractThe impact of the collisional warm-rain microphysical processes on the polarimetric radar variables is quantified using a coupled microphysics–electromagnetic scattering model. A one-dimensional bin-microphysical rain shaft model that resolves explicitly the evolution of the drop size distribution (DSD) under the influence of collisional coalescence and breakup, drop settling, and aerodynamic breakup is coupled with electromagnetic scattering calculations that simulate vertical profiles of the polarimetric radar variables: reflectivity factor at horizontal polarization ZH, differential reflectivity ZDR, and specific differential phase KDP. The polarimetric radar fingerprint of each individual microphysical process is quantified as a function of the shape of the initial DSD and for different values of nominal rainfall rate. Results indicate that individual microphysical processes (collisional processes, evaporation) display a distinctive signature and evolve within specific areas of ZH–ZDR and ZDR–KDP space. Furthermore, a comparison of the resulting simulated vertical profiles of the polarimetric variables with radar and disdrometer observations suggests that bin-microphysical parameterizations of drop breakup most frequently used are overly aggressive for the largest rainfall rates, resulting in very “tropical” DSDs heavily skewed toward smaller drops.},

abstract = {<p>This study investigates the hydrometeor development and response to cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) perturbations in convection-permitting model configurations. We present results from a real-data simulation of deep convection in the Congo basin, an idealised supercell case, and a warm-rain large-eddy simulation (LES). In each case we compare two frequently used double-moment bulk microphysics schemes and investigate the response to CDNC perturbations. In the Congo basin simulations both microphysics schemes have large positive biases in surface precipitation, frequency of high radar reflectivities and frequency of cold cloud compared to observations. In all cases, differences in the simulated cloud morphology and precipitation are found to be significantly greater between the microphysics schemes than due to CDNC perturbations within each scheme. Further, we show that the response of the hydrometeors to CDNC perturbations strongly differs not just between microphysics schemes but also between different cases of convection. Sensitivity tests show that the representation of autoconversion is the dominant factor that drives differences in rain production between the microphysics schemes in the idealised precipitating shallow cumulus case and in a sub-region of the Congo basin simulations dominated by liquid-phase processes. In this region, rain mass is also shown to be relatively insensitive to the radiative effects of an overlying layer of ice-phase cloud. In the idealised supercell case, thermodynamic impacts on the storm system using different microphysics parameterisations can equal those due to aerosol effects. These results highlight the large uncertainty in cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol in convection-permitting simulations and have important implications not just for modelling studies of aerosol-convection interaction. These results indicate the continuing need for tighter observational constraints of cloud processes and response to aerosol in a range of meteorological regimes.</p>},

The usefulness of polar-orbiting satellite aerosol retrievals in lightning inference is examined by correlating MODIS AOD retrievals with lightning observations of the thunderstorms in the summers during 2002–2014 over northern Alabama. Lightning flashes during the 1400–1700 Local Standard Time (LST) peak period show weak, but positive correlations with the MODIS AOD retrievals 2–4 hours earlier. The correlation becomes stronger in particular meteorological conditions, including weak vertical wind shear and prevailing northerly winds over northern Alabama.

abstract = {Application of clustering algorithms to ground based lightning detection networks expands the real time global observations of lightning from strokes to flashes and strokes to thunderstorms. Lightning detection networks, such as the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) or the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN), are then able to identify, locate, and analyze nearly every active thunderstorms within their operational range. Global thunderstorm information allows for research into the climatological structures of thunderstorm behavior on large spatial and temporal scales. Flash clustering allows for new network diagnostics, such as flash multiplicity and thunderstorm detection efficiency. An algorithm is used to cluster strokes to flashes and thunderstorms for both the WWLLN and ENTLN. Cross validation of the networks is performed with the located thunderstorms and comparisons of their inferred areas and duration. Overall WWLLN detects 61% of all ENTLN thunderstorm clusters and 80% of thunderstorms larger than 10 3 km 2. In ther reverse analysis, ENTLN detection of WWLLN thunderstorms , ENTLN detects 86% of all WWLLN thunderstorms over North America. On average WWLLN observes thunderstorm clusters lasting 10 minutes and spanning 66 km 2 , ENTLN observes average durations of 10 minutes and 60 km 2. Within thunderstorms the average time between flashes is 21 seconds as seen by WWLLN and 10 seconds by ENTLN, with a strong regional dependence on season. Clustering algorithms applied to lightning detection networks allow for a new range of analysis of thunderstorm effects, network performances, and the links between lightning and thunderstorms. DISCUSSION Clustering the located strokes of both WWLLN and ENTLN networks provides thunderstorm and flash data. The clustering is performed with the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm [Ester et al., 1996; Kriegel et al., 2011] following the application metholodgy discussed in Hutchins et al. [2014]. DBSCAN is used over other clustering methods as it clusters based on the spatial and temporal distance between strokes with robust handling of noise (e.g. nearby thunderstorms). The flash clustering uses the same algorithm as the thunderstorm clustering, with adjustment of the spatial and temporal clustering parameters. Within a thunderstorm cluster lightning detection networks are able to measure two properties: the interstroke and interflash timing. The full WWLLN interstroke time, Figure 1a, naturally shows two distinct peaks: one at 40 ms and another at 100 seconds with a natural inflection at 1 second. With ENTLN the interstroke distribution does not show the same distinct peaks (Figure 1c) because it is able to locate more strokes in each flash, the tail of the interstroke time distribution overlaps the interflash time distribution. In the WWLLN interevent time distribution there is a spike of events near 10 µs caused by the same event recorded twice by the network, this can also occur with ENTLN but less frequently. After the network events are clustered into flashes the time distributions can be split into the time between strokes in the same flash (black) and time between flashes (blue) in Figure 1b and 1d. The stroke and flash distribution can be fit as lognormal distributions for each day of the year, an example set of fits is shown with the dashed lines in Figure 1b and 1d. This fitting allows for the daily tracking of the interstroke (Figure 2a) and interflash (Figure 2b) times for both networks. With WWLLN the global distributions},

abstract = {Radiosonde and satellite data collected from the Atmosphere Boundary Layer Experiment--Wet Season and Amazon Water Vapor Flux Experiment are used to investigate the energy budget. The relationship between the cloud cover variability and the different terms of the energy budget equations was examined. The radiosonde data were used to compute the energy divergence flux for each triangle composed by three radiosonde stations. Earth Radiation Budget Experiment data were used to compute the radiative Aux in the top of the atmosphere. The cloud cover variability were computed from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project data. When the atmosphere undergoes a change from the mean state to the convective state, it stores energy mainly in the middle layers, while the maximum energy storage was found around 650 hPa mainly due to the perturbation of the latent energy. Conversely, when the atmosphere undergoes a change from a mean state to a nearly clear sky situation, the atmosphere column loses energy, principally due to the changes in the latent energy profile, and the atmosphere became drier, in the 700-200-hPa layer. The advective term of the energy divergence flux is of a lower order and the energy divergence flux is determined mainly from the divergent term. The profiles of the components of the energy divergence flux are essentially a result of the wind divergence weighted by the specific humidity (latent term), temperature (enthalpy term), and height (potential term). The latent energy divergence flux, for convective situations, presents a maximum in 950 hPa and is always negative (convergent) up to 400 hPa. For the nearly clear-sky situation a convergence of humidity in the lower levels and an important humidity divergence above 800 hPa were observed. The enthalpy and the latent energy divergence flux mainly describe the middle/low levels and the potential energy divergence flux represents mainly the upper troposphere. During the experiments, the solar energy absorbed by the surface was always smaller than the total surface fur supplied to the atmosphere during convective events and always larger than the total surface flux supplied to the atmosphere during nonconvective events. This means that the surface loses more energy than it receives in convective events and vice versa. The quantity of energy stored at the surface seems to be limited, defining a timescale, during which the surface needs to export or receive energy to control its deficit or gain of energy.},

Moreover, IL-6 is important in the induction of hepatic acute-phase proteins for the trafficking of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, the differentiation of adaptive T-cell responses, and tissue regeneration and homeostatic regulation. Studies have investigated IL-6 biology using cell-bound IL-6 receptors expressed predominantly on hepatocytes and certain haematopoietic cells versus activation mediated by IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptors via a second protein, gp130, which is expressed throughout the body. Advances in this research elucidating the differential effects of IL-6 activation provide important insights into the role of IL-6 in health and disease, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. Knowledge of the basic biology of IL-6 and its signalling pathways can better inform both the research agenda for IL-6-based targeted therapies as well as the clinical use of strategies affecting IL-6-mediated inflammation. This Review covers novel, emerging aspects of the biology of IL-6, which might lead to more specific blockade of IL-6 signalling without compromising the protective function of this cytokine in the body's defence against infections.},

The storm produced 116 total flashes of which only 6 were discharges to ground. The initial discharge occurred during a period of vigorous vertical development, approximately 4-6 min after small hail was first indicated by radar. The peak flash rate of 23 flashes min−1 occurred only 7-8 min later, 4 min prior to microburst onset, in conjunction with the peak in storm mass, vertically integrated liquid water content, echo volume, and cloud height. An abrupt decrease in the total flash rates is associated with storm collapse and serves as a precursor to the arrival of the maximum microburst outflows at the surface. Ice-phase precipitation is shown to be an important factor in both the formation of the strong downdraft and the electrification of the storm.},

abstract = {Riming electrification was studied in cold room experiments simulating thunderstorm conditions. When both ice crystals and supercooled droplets coexist in the experimental chamber, high electric charge occurs on the riming probes. Both the sign and magnitude of riming electrification are highly dependent on the temperature and cloud water content. Electric charge of the order of 10−4 esu (33 fC) is separated on riming with each ice crystal collision under conditions typical of the in-cloud environment of continental thunderstorms. This amount of charge is sufficient to produce the high electrification required for lightning discharge within reasonably short periods of time. The effect of the electrical field on charge separation during the riming and effect of the freezing potential of drops of rime also were examined. It appears that these effects play only a secondary role for charge separation in thunderstorms. Three different physical mechanisms of charge separation during riming are proposed and discussed to explain the riming charge under different conditions of temperature and cloud water content. Possible differences in the character of thunderstorms at various geographical locations are briefly considered.},

The storm produced 116 total flashes of which only 6 were discharges to ground. The initial discharge occurred during a period of vigorous vertical development, approximately 4-6 min after small hail was first indicated by radar. The peak flash rate of 23 flashes min−1 occurred only 7-8 min later, 4 min prior to microburst onset, in conjunction with the peak in storm mass, vertically integrated liquid water content, echo volume, and cloud height. An abrupt decrease in the total flash rates is associated with storm collapse and serves as a precursor to the arrival of the maximum microburst outflows at the surface. Ice-phase precipitation is shown to be an important factor in both the formation of the strong downdraft and the electrification of the storm.},

abstract = {This study investigates the kinematic and microphysical control of lightning properties, particularly those that may govern the production of nitrogen oxides (NOX = NO + NO2) via lightning (LNOX), such as flash rate, type, and extent. The NASA Lightning Nitrogen Oxides Model (LNOM) is applied to lightning observations following multicell thunderstorms through their lifecycle in a Lagrangian sense over Northern Alabama on 21 May 2012 during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment. LNOM provides estimates of flash rate, type, channel length distributions, channel segment altitude distributions (SADs), and LNOX production profiles. The LNOM-derived lightning characteristics and LNOX production are compared to the evolution of radar-inferred updraft and precipitation properties. Intercloud, intracloud (IC) flash SAD comprises a significant fraction of the total (IC + cloud-to-ground [CG]) SAD, while increased CG flash SAD at altitudes >6 km occurs after the simultaneous peaks in several thunderstorm properties (i.e., total [IC + CG] and IC flash rate, graupel volume/mass, convective updraft volume, and maximum updraft speed). At heights <6 km, the CG LNOX production dominates the column-integrated total LNOX production. Unlike the SAD, total LNOX production consists of a more equal contribution from IC and CG flashes for heights >6 km. Graupel volume/mass, updraft volume, and maximum updraft speed are all well correlated to the total flash rate (correlation coefficient, $\rho$ ≥ 0.8) but are less correlated to total flash extent ($\rho$ ≥ 0.6) and total LNOX production ($\rho$ ≥ 0.5). Although LNOM transforms lightning observations into LNOX production values, these values are estimates and are subject to further independent validation.},

A nonlinear least-squares minimization procedure has been developed to describe changes in the total electrostatic field produced by lightning in terms of point charge models for the cloud charge distributions. The results of this analysis indicate that discharges to ground usually neutralize cloud charges in the range from −10 to −40 C. The computed charge altitudes for Florida are somewhat higher than for other geographical locations, 6 to 9.5 km, but the corresponding ambient air temperatures, −10 to −34°C, are similar. A large fraction of the discharges to ground show total field changes which are small or even reversed in polarity within 3 km of the discharges. An analysis of these cases suggests that ground discharges often neutralize a small positive charge, 0.5 to 4 C at altitudes ...},

Polarimetric radar indications of hail (high reflectivity and low differential reflectivity) appeared near the surface in the echo core adjacent to the aircraft track approximately 6 min after the T-28's inflow transit. Radial velocity data from the KFTG radar were combined with those recorded at CSU-CHILL to synthesize the airflow fields in the storm around the time of the T-28 penetration. Hail trajectories were initiated from a location at which the T-28 encountered a burst of approximately 1-cm-diameter, low-density graupel particles within the general storm inflow region. Forward-time trajectory calculations indicated that these graupel particles subsequently grew slightly into small hailstones and ended up within a few kilometers of the near-surface polarimetric radar hail-signature location. Trajectories computed backward in time imply that these hail embryos originated aloft in the forward portion of the echo complex. These are the first quantitative, direct in situ observations of recirculating precipitation becoming embryos for hail development .},

The average number of flash per storm and air temperature in three different ranges of PM10 concentrations was also examined. For the first one, there is an increase of the average number of flash per storm from low to intermediate range and a trend to decrease from intermediate to high range. However, the air temperature tends to stay the same in all ranges. These results suggest that pollution tends to saturate the intensification of storms and lightning activity in a specific level. After that, the increase of aerosols provided by pollution tends to decrease the lightning activity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An algorithm based on a support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for hydrometeor classification. The training phase is driven by the output of a fuzzy logic hydrometeor classification algorithm, i.e., the most popular approach for hydrometer classification algorithms used for ground-based weather radar. The performance of SVM is evaluated by resorting to a weather scenario, generated by a weather model; the corresponding radar measurements are obtained by simulation and by comparing results of SVM classification with those obtained by a fuzzy logic classifier. Results based on the weather model and simulations show a higher accuracy of the SVM classification. Objective comparison of the two classifiers applied to real radar data shows that SVM classification maps are spatially more homogenous (textural indices, energy, and homogeneity increases by 21% and 12% respectively) and do not present non-classified data. The improvements found by SVM classifier, even though it is applied pixel-by-pixel, can be attributed to its ability to learn from the entire hyperspace of radar measurements and to the accurate training. The reliability of results and higher computing performance make SVM attractive for some challenging tasks such as its implementation in Decision Support Systems for helping pilots to make optimal decisions about changes inthe flight route caused by unexpected adverse weather.},

Similar to earlier results for thunderstorm microbursts, the peak flash rate precedes the severe weather at the ground by 5-20 min. A distinguishing feature of severe storms is the presence of lightning 'jumps' - abrupt increases in flash rate in advance of the maximum rate for the storm. The systematic total lightning precursor to severe weather of all kinds - wind, hail, tornadoes - is interpreted in terms of the updraft that sows the seeds aloft for severe weather at the surface and simultaneously stimulates the ice microphysics that drives the intracloud lightning activity.},

abstract = {Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data, wind field data derived from dual-Doppler radars, and radar reflectivity data are combined to investigate the relationships between CG lightning and the parameters associated with vertical airflow. A new method for the identification of thunderstorm cells based on the aggregation of flashes is developed. It is found that approximately 79.1% of CG flashes are located in the region featuring weak vertical velocity at the 0 °C level, ranging from − 5 to 5 m s− 1, with the majority in the weak updraft region, especially for negative CG lightning and the CG lightning in the initial stage of thunderstorms. The CG lightning rate is correlated with the volume of updraft for vertical velocities within certain limits. The sum of absolute precipitation ice mass flux in the region from 7 to 11 km is more significantly correlated with the CG flash rate, with correlation coefficients of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.74 for the initial, mature, and dissipating stages of thunderstorms, respectively. On average, the updraft in the thunderstorm at the stage when the last CG flash occurs accounts for a much smaller ratio to the whole volume of the thunderstorm than that corresponding to the first CG flash. The maximum updraft and maximum height of the 10 and 20 m s− 1 updraft speeds are close for the first and last CG flashes, indicating the dependence of the lightning on strength of updraft. It is deduced that layered large-range charges may be more conducive to the generation of CG flashes than charge pockets in the thunderstorm.},

abstract = {AbstractAnalyses of the radar-observed structure and derived rainfall statistics of warm-season convection developing columns of enhanced positive differential reflectivity (ZDR) over England's southwest peninsula are presented here. Previous observations of ZDR columns in developing cumulonimbus clouds over England were rare. The observations presented herein suggest otherwise, at least in the southwesterly winds over the peninsula. The results are the most extensive of their kind in the UK; the data were collected using the National Centre for Atmospheric Science dual-polarization X-band radar (NXPol) during the COnvective Precipitation Experiment (COPE). In contrast to recent studies of ZDR columns focused on deep clouds that developed in high-instability environments, the COPE measurements show relatively frequent ZDR columns in shallower clouds, many only 4-5 km deep.The presence of ZDR columns is used to infer an active warm rain process has contributed to precipitation evolution in convection deep ...},

abstract = {A kinematic, dynamic, and thermodynamic analysis of a weakly sheared, airmass thunderstorm observed over northern Alabama is presented. Most notable is the fact that the dominant cell in this storm closely resembles the Byers and Braham model for warm-based, airmass storms. Several phenomena never documented for this storm-type are discussed. One of these is a strong and deep downdraft observed at midlevels with an associated weak echo trench. Its origin appears to be related to a wake entrainment process. A midlevel inflow which causes visible constriction in the storm cloud is also observed. This inflow results in a division of the thermal buoyancy into two maxima in the vertical; one associated with the precipitation core and the other with strong positive vertical motions in the growing cumulus turret. In addition, a downdraft separate from that seen at midlevels develops at low levels and causes a microburst outflow at the surface. This downdraft appears to be initiated by precipitation loading and intensified by negative thermal buoyancy. The Byers and Braham model of the cumulus, mature and dissipating stages is discussed in light of these new features.},

abstract = {A long-standing but fundamental question in lightning studies concerns how lightning is initiated inside storms, given the absence of physical conductors. The issue has revolved around the question of whether the discharges are initiated solely by conventional dielectric breakdown or involve relativistic runaway electron processes. Here we report observations of a relatively unknown type of discharge, called fast positive breakdown, that is the cause of high-power discharges known as narrow bipolar events. The breakdown is found to have a wide range of strengths and is the initiating event of numerous lightning discharges. It appears to be purely dielectric in nature and to consist of a system of positive streamers in a locally intense electric field region. It initiates negative breakdown at the starting location of the streamers, which leads to the ensuing flash. The observations show that many or possibly all lightning flashes are initiated by fast positive breakdown.},

The tendency expressed in the observational record is that the most intense tornadoes are typically the widest. Herein we explore the simple hypothesis that wide, intense tornadoes should form more readily out of wide, rotating updrafts. This hypothesis is based on an application of Kelvin's circulation theorem, which is used to argue that the large circulation associated with a wide, intense tornado is more plausibly associated with a wide mesocyclone. Because a mesocyclone is, strictly speaking, a rotating updraft, the mesocyclone width should increase with increasing updraft width. A simple mathematical model that is quantified using observations of mesocyclones supports this hypothesis, as do idealized numerical simulations of supercellular thunderstorms.},

abstract = {Abstract The kinetic energy of hailfalls is measured with a 10 cm radar. For comparison of the results a total of 204 hailpad stations was used covering an area of 780 km2, i.e., one pad per 3.8 km2. The experimental setup is such that the largest distance between any hailpad and the radar is less than 30 km. The radar is accurately calibrated with raindrop disdrometers and hailstone spectrometers. The radar data consist of PPI pictures obtained at a constant elevation angle of 5.5° with a time resolution of 1 min and a reflectivity resolution of 5 dBZ. The radar reflectivity values are transformed into kinetic energies by means of empirical Z–Ė relations obtained from measured time-resolved hailstone spectra. The data of six severe hailstorms are studied and the following results are obtained: 1) The correlation coefficient of corresponding hailpad and radar derived kinetic energies at single points of a hailstorm is 0.7, a value which can be increased to 0.8 if four-point averages are taken; 2) the global kinetic energy Eg(Z) of a hailfall calculated from radar data agrees to better than 20% with the corresponding value Eg deduced from hailpad information; and 3) the agreement between Eg(Z) and Eg of a hailstorm is better than a few percent for the two cases for which individual Z–Ė relations are available.},

The inner core updrafts were weaker and experienced greater depletion of cloud water by warm rain processes, which, in contrast to the deeper updrafts in the rainband convection, reduced the mixed-phase cloud depth and confined the bulk of the charging and lightning initiations to lower levels.Notably larger flash rates were produced in the asymmetric inner core of the SHEAR case, with the ma...},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an algorithm for tracking and forecasting radiative and morphological characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) through their entire life cycles using geostationary satellite thermal channel information (10.8 $\mu$m). The main features of this system are the following: 1) a cloud cluster detection method based on a threshold temperature (235 K), 2) a tracking technique based on MCS overlapping areas in successive images, and 3) a forecast module based on the evolution of each particular MCS in previous steps. This feature is based on the MCS's possible displacement (considering the center of the mass position of the cloud cluster in previous time steps) and its size evolution. Statistical information about MCS evolution during the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) of the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) was used to obtain area expansion mean rates for different MCSs according to their lifetime durations. This nowcasting tool was applied to evaluate the MCS displacement and size evolution over the Del Plata basin in South America up to 120 min with 30-min intervals. The Forecast and Tracking the Evolution of Cloud Clusters (ForTraCC) technique's performance was evaluated based on the difference between the forecasted and observed images. This evaluation shows good agreement between the observed and forecast size and minimum temperature for shorter forecast lead times, but tends to underestimate MCS size (and overestimate the minimum temperature) for larger forecast lead times.},

abstract = {An electrification and lightning flash scheme was run in a cloud-resolving model to study the electrical structure of idealized convective storms with several charge separation parameterizations. The electrification of an intense multicellular storm was first simulated. The results confirm the sensitivity of the cloud polarity and lightning flash characteristics to three noninductive charging formulations. Furthermore, it is found that the inductive charging is an efficient mechanism to enhance the lower electric charge, which favors cloud-to-ground flashes. Then, microphysical and electrical budgets were calculated for the convective and stratiform regions of a two-dimensional squall line. The simulation shows that the liquid water content is high enough to generate graupel by riming. Thus the noninductive separation process is efficient to charge the stratiform plume as well, and lightning flashes can be triggered. Finally, the application of various noninductive charging schemes to several convective storms showed the storm electrification variability, which heavily depends on the cloud dynamics and microphysics. The study reveals some remarkable features concerning the charge structure and the cloud-to-ground flash polarity.},

At low temperatures (below −19°C), the results revealed no dependence of the charge separated per collision upon variations of the liquid water content. While at temperatures above −19°C, the efficiency of the graupel charging could decrease as the liquid water content increases, as a consequence of the decrease of the probability that the ice crystals impact and rebound from the graupel surface in the dry growth regime. We found that the dominant sign of the graupel charging was negative for temperatures below −15°C and positive at higher temperatures. A simple functional representation of our laboratory results is given so that they can be incorporated in cloud electrification models.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most familiar and widely recognized natural phenomena, lightning remains relatively poorly understood. Even the most basic questions of how lightning is initiated inside thunderclouds and how it then propagates for many tens of kilometers have only begun to be addressed. In the past, progress was hampered by the unpredictable and transient nature of lightning and the difficulties in making direct measurements inside thunderstorms, but advances in instrumentation, remote sensing methods, and rocket-triggered lightning experiments are now providing new insights into the physics of lightning. Furthermore, the recent discoveries of intense bursts of X-rays and gamma-rays associated with thunderstorms and lightning illustrate that new and interesting physics is still being discovered in our atmosphere. The study of lightning and related phenomena involves the synthesis of many branches of physics, from atmospheric physics to plasma physics to quantum electrodynamics, and provides a plethora of challenging unsolved problems. In this review, we provide an introduction to the physics of lightning with the goal of providing interested researchers a useful resource for starting work in this fascinating field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The present study makes use of cloud-to-ground lightning, three-dimensional mapping from a Lightning Mapping Array and Doppler C-band radar observations to analyze the lightning trends and the underlying electrical charge structure of a large-hail bearing storm that produced important damages on the local agriculture. The analysis reported an extremely active storm, evolving through distinct phases, which stood out from a multicell structure to finally become a supercell. The onset of newer regions of convective development interacting with the main cell made the charge structure to be rather complex during some stages of this long-lived hailstorm. Evidence suggests the presence of regions with the charge layer being inverted from that of normal, non-severe convective storms, producing predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The analysis also suggests that strong cloud signals were misclassified as low peak current single-stroke negative cloud-to-ground flashes, masking the predominant positive nature of the storm.},

abstract = {The Brazilian lightning detection network detected about 310,000 cloud-to-ground flashes over three large metropolitan areas in Southeastern Brazil during three summer seasons (from 2000 to 2002). It was observed an enhancement of 60–100% in the flash density over the urban areas compared to their surroundings. Conversely, a decrease of 7–8% in the percentage of positive flashes was also observed. The spatial distribution of the flashes follows closely the shape of the S{\~{a}}o Paulo city heat island, thereby supporting the thermal hypothesis. The PM10 concentration showed a positive linear correlation with the number of cloud-to-ground flashes and a negative correlation with the percentage of positive flashes, supporting the aerosol hypothesis. These results indicate that both hypotheses should be considered to explain the CG lightning enhancements over the urban areas. However, only the aerosol hypothesis could better support the decrease of the percentage of positive flashes.},

The results indicate that the radiative effect of aerosol may be one of the main reason for the decrease of the lightning flash density in a long period, while the aerosol microphysical effect may be a major role in the increase of the percent of +CG flashes (P+CG). The dependence of surface temperature, CAPE, and thunderstorm days on AOD (R = -0.748, -0.741, -0.744), and the negative correlation (R = -0.634) between lightning flash density and AOD may lend support for the radiative effect of aerosol on lightning. In addition, elevated aerosols may change the charge distribution in thundercloud, hence enhancing the positive cloud-to-ground lightning (+CG) activity, as P+CG is positively correlated with AOD.},

There are three main components, producing analyses and forecasts of precipitation, cloud and visibility, respectively. The precipitation rate analysis uses processed radar and satellite data, together with surface reports and NWP fields. The forecast is based on an object advection technique, modified for growth and decay using model products. Related variables, such as precipitation type, are also diagnosed using the NWP fields. The cloud analysis is based largely on satellite imagery and surface reports, the forecast being carried out in a similar way to precipitation rate. The visibility analysis combines surface reports with NWP model fields and satellite imagery: Meteosat during the day and NOAA–AVHRR at night. The forecast is an extrapolation using trends from the NWP model, and relaxing towards the model values themselves. Results show a substantial improvement over both persistence and raw NWP model products.},

abstract = {This article presents a 13-year hail climatology for Switzerland based on volumetric radar reflectivity. Two radar-based hail detection products that are used operationally at MeteoSwiss, namely the Probability of Hail (POH) and the Maximum Expected Severe Hail Size (MESHS), have been reprocessed for the extended convective season (April–September) between 2002 and 2014. The result of these two products is a comprehensive hail distribution map, which highlights regional and local-scale hail characteristics. The map of the annual number of hail days shows a high spatial variability and several maxima over the foothills north and south of the Alps as wells as over the Jura mountains. Directly over the Alps hail frequency exhibits a minimum. Annual hail anomalies show a pronounced variability, which suggests that hail occurrence is strongly controlled by large-scale weather patterns. Furthermore, hail probability exhibits a strong seasonal and diurnal cycle with a maximum in July in the late afternoon. The hail peak over the northern pre-alpine region occurs approximately two hours earlier compared to the south. A possible explanation is the trigger mechanism between the cold pool initiated by early convective cells over the Jura mountains and the development of cells on the northern slope of the Alps. Since radar-based hail signals are only indirect measurements, statistical verification of the hail detection algorithms is crucial. Damage reports from an automobile insurance company are used as an independent dataset. Verification results confirm that radar-based hail algorithms provide valuable information on hail probability. Finally, the synoptic-scale hail-driving weather conditions are investigated using a weather type classification based on upper-air flow direction and mean pressure from a numerical weather prediction model. The results show that six out of nine main synoptic-scale patterns favour the development of hailstorms in Switzerland.},

It is hoped that these observations could enlighten some of the complex relationships existing between intensity fluctuations and the distribution of electrified convection in these systems.Prior to rapidly intensifying from a category one to five storm, Maria produced few inner core flashes. Increases in total lightning in the inner core (r ≤ 100-km) occurred during both the beginning and end of an intensification cycle while lightning increases in the outer region (100-km < r ≤ 500-km) occurred earlier in the intensification cycle, and during weakening.Throughout the analysis period, the largest lightning rates in the outer r...},

abstract = {On 14 June 2011, thunderstorms developed along a cold front in central Oklahoma in a thermodynamic environment that was conducive for downbursts. One of the thunderstorms produced a wet downburst in Norman, Oklahoma, that resulted in surface winds in excess of 35 m s21 (.80 mi h21 ) and hailstones in excess of 4 cm in diameter. Unique 1-min observations of the downburst were recorded by an Oklahoma Mesonet station. These observations indicated a 6.6-hPa pressure rise that was coincident with a rain rate of 213 mm h21 at the center of the downburst. In this event, both the research KOUN (Norman) and operational KTLX (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) instruments were scanning this downburst and its parent storm at close range (,30 km). KOUN provided polarimetric radar data (PRD) while both radars provided limited dualDoppler coverage. The evolution of the downburst is analyzed mostly through the use of reconstructed range–height indicators of the PRD. A hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA) is applied to the PRD to gain further understanding of the microphysical evolution of the downburst. Through the analyses, it is seen that graupel aloft made a transition to a nearly all rain and hail mixture above the 08C level. This large area of mixed rain and hail eventually descended to the ground, causing the downburst. In this study, the HCA analyses are utilized to develop a conceptual model that characterizes the hydrometeor evolution of the parent downburst storm.},

In a first step, the optimal num-ber of hydrometeor classes (n opt) that can be reliably identi-fied from a large set of polarimetric data is determined. This is done by means of an unsupervised clustering technique guided by criteria related both to data similarity and to spatial smoothness of the classified images. In a second step, the n opt clusters are assigned to the appropriate hydrometeor class by means of human interpretation and comparisons with the out-put of other classification techniques. The main innovation in the proposed method is the unsupervised part: the hydrome-teor classes are not defined a priori, but they are learned from data. The approach is applied to data collected by an X-band polarimetric weather radar during two field campaigns (from which about 50 precipitation events are used in the present study). Seven hydrometeor classes (n opt=7) have been found in the data set, and they have been identified as light rain (LR), rain (RN), heavy rain (HR), melting snow (MS), ice crys-tals/small aggregates (CR), aggregates (AG), and rimed-ice particles (RI).},

Dual-frequency observations at X and C band in Germany and dual-frequency observations at C and S band in the United States are compared to explore the regional frequency dependencies of the $\delta$ signature. Theoretical simulations based on usual assumptions about the microphysical composition of the melting layer cannot reproduce the observed large values of $\delta$ at the lower-frequency bands and also underestimate the enhancements in differential reflectivity ZDR and reductions in the cross-correlation coefficient ?h?. Simulations using a two-layer T-matrix code and a simple model for the representation of accretion can, however, explain the pronounced $\delta$ signatures at S and C bands in conjunction with small $\delta$ at X band. The authors conclude that the $\delta$ signature bears information about microphysical accretion and aggregation processes in the melting layer and the degree of riming of the snowflakes aloft.},

abstract = {Comprehensive measurements of midlevel mixed-phase clouds in the mid-latitude region were conducted during the CLEX-9 campaign in North Platte (41.13N, 100.68W) Nebraska from October to November 2001. The experiment was accomplished by employing the University of Wyoming King Air (UWKA) aircraft equipped with typical in-situ cloud microphysical instruments. The campaign flew ten flight missions in eight different days, accumulated more than 16 hours of in-cloud observational data. Approximately 2/3 of the thirty (30) total measured effective cloud profiles show a common feature that super-cooled liquid droplets were topped or near the top of the clouds with ice particles falling as virga beneath. We refer to this common structure as liquid topped mixed-phase cloud. This discovery confirms an earlier speculation that the midlevel mixed-phase clouds in the mid-latitude region possesses a microphysical structure similar to that recently reported for mixed-phase Arctic stratus. Another interesting phenomena is that the remaining 1/3 of the total measured effective cloud profiles are ice dominated cloud with little liquid water content. To understand the radiative transfer properties of this liquid topped mixed-phase altocumulus cloud and its contribution to the satellite remote sensing, a cloud profile with a nearly simultaneous TERRA/MODIS satellite overpass has been thoroughly sampled and is being parameterized for the purpose of the radiative transfer study. The cloud has been sliced into thin layers of 100 meter thickness. The droplet and ice crystal size distributions at each layer have been derived. The cloud habits have been simply divided into three categories of liquid droplet, sector plate, and aggregate/dendrite. The three habit fractions as a function of height have been determined. A very large fraction of water appeared at the cloud top and sharply decreased to a very small value. The small sector plate crystals were distributed in all cloud layers, but peaked immediately beneath the thin water layer. The large aggregates/dendrites were also distributed everywhere in the cloud, but had maximum habit fractions at the cloud bottom. The following summarizes additional ongoing and future research associated with the radiative transfer study of midlevel, mixed-phase clouds: The optical properties of individual particle have been computed. A new mixture scheme for modeling the mixed-phase cloud is being developed. The bulk cloud particle optical properties at each sliced layer will be computed and tabulated into a library. Combining this pre-computed cloud library, in-situ atmospheric profiles, and surface parameters, the upwelling radiance to the satellite sensor will be accurately estimated. Finally, a study on the sensitivity of satellite sensor channels to variability in the specific cloud profile presented herein and TERRA/MODIS validation will be documented in future papers.},

abstract = {Abstract The majority (61%) of severe storm reports (i.e., large hail and tornado) during the 1989–98 warm seasons (April–September) were associated with predominantly (>90%) negative cloud-to-ground (PNCG) lightning. Across the contiguous United States, only 15% of severe storm reports were characterized by predominantly (>50%) positive CG (PPCG) lightning activity. However, significant regional variability occurred in the relationship between warm season severe storm reports and CG lightning polarity. In the eastern United States, a significant fraction (81%) of severe storm reports occurred nearby PNCG lightning while only 2% of severe storms were associated with PPCG lightning. The CG lightning behavior was quite different over the northern plains; only 28% of severe storm reports were linked with PNCG lightning while 43% were characterized by PPCG lightning. Although the direct physical relationship is still not evident, this regional variability appears to be at least partially explained by differen...},

The algorithm framework has been tested on 20 thunderstorms, including 1 nonsevere storm, which occurred over the course of six separate days during the spring months of 2002 and 2003. The identified surges in lightning rate (or jumps) are compared against 110 documented severe weather events produced by these thunderstorms as they moved across portions of northern Alabama and southern Tennessee. Lightning jumps precede 90% of these severe weather events, with as much as a 27-min advance notification of impending severe weather on the ground. However, 37% of lightning jumps are not followed by severe weather reports. Various configurations of the algorithm are tested, and the highest critical success index attained is 0.49.

abstract = {This study assesses the impact of urban land use on the climatological distribution of thunderstorm initiation occurrences in the humid subtropical region of the Southeast United States, which includes the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Initially, an automated technique is developed to extract the locations of isolated convective initiation (ICI) events from 17 years (1997–2013) of composite reflectivity radar data for the study area. Nearly 26,000 ICI points were detected during 85 warm-season months, providing the foundation for first long-term, systematic assessment of the influence of urban land use on thunderstorm development. Results reveal that ICI events occur more often over the urban area compared to its surrounding rural counterparts, confirming that anthropogenic-induced changes in land cover in moist tropical environments lead to more initiation events, resulting thunderstorms, and affiliated hazards over the developed area. The ICI risk for Atlanta is greatest during the late afternoon and early evening in July and August in synoptically benign conditions. Greater ICI counts downwind of Atlanta suggest that prevailing wind direction also influences the location of these events. Moreover, ICI occurrences over the city were significantly higher on weekdays compared to weekend days—a result that was not apparent in a rural control region located west of the city. This suggests that the weekly commuting cycle and associated aerosol levels of Atlanta may amplify ICI rates. The investigation provides a methodological framework for future studies that examine the effect of land use, land cover, and terrain discontinuities on the spatiotemporal character of ICI events.},

The characteristics of these fields are discussed according to the streamtrace pattern, pressure deviation, z-velocity and vorticity fields. While the upstream flow remains quasi-steady, the wakes of these fields are increasingly turbulent and the maximum velocity region flanking the recirculation bubble exhibits a ring-shedding phenomenon as the Reynolds number increases. The eddy length and drag coefficient for each cases are also calculated and empirical relations are provided. Potential impacts of these characteristics to the cloud physical of hail are also discussed. An outlook of future works is also given. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional cloud-resolving simulation is combined with dual-Doppler and polarimetric radar analysis to study the evolution, dynamic structure, cloud microphysics, and rainfall processes of monsoon convection observed during the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon onset. Overall, the model simulations show many similarities to the radar observations. The rainband associated with the convection remains at a very stable position throughout its life cycle in the northern SCS. The reflectivity pattern exhibits a straight upward structure with little tilt. The positions of the convective, transition, and stratiform regions produced by the model are consistent with the observations. The major difference from the observations is that the model tends to overestimate the magnitude of updraft. As a result, the maximum reflectivity generated by the model appears at an elevated altitude. The surface rainfall processes and associated thermodynamic, dynamic, and cloud microphysical processes are examined by the model in terms of surface rainfall, temperature and moisture perturbations, circulations, and cloud microphysical budget. At the preformation and dissipating stages, although local vapor change and vapor convergence terms are the major contributors in determining rain rate, they cancel each other out and cause little rain. The vapor convergence/divergence is closely related to the lower-tropospheric updraft/subsidence during the early/ late stages of the convection. During the formation and mature phases, vapor convergence term is in control of the rainfall processes. Meanwhile, water microphysical processes are dominant in these stages. The active vapor condensation process causes a large amount of raindrops through the collection of cloud water by raindrops. Ice microphysical processes including riming are negligible up to the mature phase but are dominant during the weakening stage. Cloud source/sink terms make some contributions to the rain rate at the formation and weakening stages, while the role of surface evaporation term is negligible throughout the life cycle of the convection. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Approximately 63 million lightning flashes have been identified and analyzed from multiple years of Washington, D. C., northern Alabama, and northeast Colorado lightning mapping array (LMA) data using an open-source flash-clustering algorithm. LMA networks detect radiation produced by lightning breakdown processes, allowing for high-resolution mapping of lightning flashes. Similar to other existing clustering algorithms, the algorithm described herein groups lightning-produced radiation sources by space and time to estimate total flash counts and information about each detected flash. Various flash characteristics and their sensitivity to detection efficiency are investigated to elucidate biases in the algorithm, detail detection efficiencies of various LMAs, and guide future improvements. Furthermore, flash density values in each region are compared to corresponding satellite estimates. While total flash density values produced by the algorithm in Washington, D. C. ($\sim$20 flashes km 2 yr 1), and Alabama ($\sim$35 flashes km 2 yr 1) are within 50% of satellite estimates, LMA-based estimates are approximately a factor of 3 larger (50 flashes km 2 yr 1) than satellite estimates in northeast Colorado. Accordingly, estimates of the ratio of in-cloud to cloud-to-ground flashes near the LMA network ($\sim$20) are approximately a factor of 3 larger than satellite estimates in Colorado. These large differences between estimates may be related to the distinct environment conducive to intense convection, low-altitude flashes, and unique charge structures in northeast Colorado.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Meteorological Society.This work evaluates the performance of a recently developed cloud-scale lightning data assimilation technique implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting Model running at convection-allowing scales (4-km grid spacing). Data provided by the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network for the contiguous United States (CONUS) were assimilated in real time over 67 days spanning the 2013 warm season (May-July). The lightning data were assimilated during the first 2 h of simulations each day. Bias-corrected, neighborhood-based, equitable threat scores (BC-ETSs) were the chief metric used to quantify the skill of the forecasts utilizing this assimilation scheme. Owing to inferior observational data quality over mountainous terrain, this evaluation focused on the eastern two-thirds of the United States. During the first 3 h following the assimilation (i.e., 3-h forecasts), all the simulations suffered from a high wet bias in forecasted accumulated precipitation (APCP), particularly for the lightning assimilation run (LIGHT). Forecasts produced by LIGHT, however, had a noticeable, statistically significant ($\alpha$ = 0.05) improvement over those by the control run (CTRL) up to 6 h into the forecast with BC-ETS differences often exceeding 0.4. This improvement was seen independently of the APCP threshold (ranging from 2.5 to 50 mm) and the neighborhood radius (ranging from 0 to 40 km) selected. Past 6 h of the forecast, the APCP fields from LIGHT progressively converged to that of CTRL probably due to the longer-term evolution being bounded by the large-scale model environment. Thus, this computationally inexpensive lightning assimilation scheme shows considerable promise for routinely improving short-term (≤6 h) forecasts of high-impact weather by convection-allowing forecast models.},

abstract = {We have examined summertime 1998–2009 U.S. lightning data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) to look for weekly cycles in lightning activity. As was found by Bell et al. (2008) for rain over the southeast U.S., there is a significant weekly cycle in afternoon lightning activity that peaks in the middle of the week there. The weekly cycle appears to be reduced over population centers. Lightning activity peaks on weekends over waters near the SE U.S. The statistical significance of weekly cycles over the western half of the country is generally small. We found no evidence of a weekly cycle of synoptic-scale forcing that might explain these patterns. The lightning behavior is entirely consistent with the explanation suggested by Bell et al. (2008) for the cycles in rainfall and other atmospheric data from the SE U.S., that aerosols can cause storms to intensify in humid, convectively unstable environments.},

@article{Allen2017,
abstract = {AbstractThe spatial distribution of return intervals for U.S. hail size is explored within the framework of extreme value theory using observations from the period 1979-2013. The center of the continent has experienced hail in excess of 5 inches in the past 30 years, whereas hail in excess of 1 inch is more common in other regions, including the West Coast. Observed hail sizes show heavy quantization toward fixed diameter reference objects and are influenced by spatial and temporal biases similar to those noted for hail occurrence. Recorded hail diameters have been growing in recent decades due to improved reporting. These data limitations motivate exploration of extreme value distributions to represent the return periods for various hail diameters. The parameters of a Gumbel distribution are fit to dithered observed annual maxima on a national 1° × 1° grid at locations with sufficient records. Gridded and kernel smoothed return sizes and quantiles up to the 200-year return period are determined for the f...},

@article{Heinselman2006a,
abstract = {This study describes, illustrates, and validates hail detection by a simplified version of the National Severe Storms Laboratory's fuzzy logic polarimetric hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA). The HCA uses four radar variables: reflectivity, differential reflectivity, cross-correlation coefficient, and “reflectivity texture” to classify echoes as rain mixed with hail, ground clutter–anomalous propagation, biological scatterers (insects, birds, and bats), big drops, light rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain. Diagnostic capabilities of HCA, such as detection of hail, are illustrated for a variety of storm environments using polarimetric radar data collected mostly during the Joint Polarimetric Experiment (JPOLE; 28 April–13 June 2003). Hail classification with the HCA is validated using 47 rain and hail reports collected by storm-intercept teams during JPOLE. For comparison purposes, probability of hail output from the Next-Generation Weather Radar Hail Detection Algorithm (HDA) is validated using the same ground truth. The anticipated polarimetric upgrade of the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler network drives this direct comparison of performance. For the four examined cases, contingency table statistics show that the HCA outperforms the HDA. The superior performance of the HCA results primary from the algorithm's lack of false alarms compared to the HDA. Statistical significance testing via bootstrapping indicates that differences in the probability of detection and critical success index between the algorithms are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, whereas differences in the false alarm rate and Heidke skill score are statistically significant at the 90% confidence level.},

abstract = {A 10-year study of lightning fatalities in Brazil is presented. It is the most complete study undertaken in South America. The study indicates the death rates in the country sorted by season, state, city, type of region, age, gender and circumstances. Ten years of data were collected from the Federal Civil Defense Agency, the Ministry of Health and the media press. The circumstances of lightning fatalities in Brazil were compared with other countries that have this information available. It also includes an analysis of the differences involved in lightning deaths in each region of Brazil. The results suggest that specific actions should be adopted in terms of lightning protection to minimize risks. Finally, this study provides useful information in order to identify the most important lightning safety rules for the country. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Pedernera2018,
abstract = {The onset of the aggregation process of frozen droplets was investigated in laboratory settings. The experiments were conducted in a cloud chamber controlled at temperatures cooler than −40°C, where pure water droplets freeze spontaneously without the need for ice nucleating particles. We present laboratory evidence supporting that the aggregation process can occur for frozen droplet sizes around 10 microns in diameter and at concentrations observed in the cloud chamber of 70 ±20 cm -3 , which can be found in some regions of anvil cirrus. The characteristics and morphology of the aggregates were examined in detail. Additional experiments performed with electrically charged droplets show that the aggregation processes can be significantly accelerated; suggesting that the mechanism of collision and adhesion could be related to electrical forces generated by different charge distributions or dipole interactions between the interacting ice surfaces. The current work aims at advancing our fundamental understanding of the aggregation process of frozen droplets, which is necessary for understanding the cloud microphysical processes.},
