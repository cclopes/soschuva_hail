Main program: 'DDA.cpp'
Sample makefile script: 'Makefile' - generates executable 'DDA'
Simple plotting scripts: DDA_plot.py (Python), DDA_plot.m (Matlab)

Output:

anal.nc - analyzed U, V, W (used as input for DDA_plot.py) 
u.dat, v.dat, w.dat, vr.dat, vr2.dat, ref.dat, azi.dat, radar.dat, grid.dat - used as input for DDA_plot.m

There is no input namelist; all user-tunable variables are set in main(), ReadDORADE() and ReadFORAY() in DDA.cpp.
Be sure to set the user-defined parameters near the top of the program; these determine the sizes of certain arrays.
Some users may find it useful to substantially modify the code to better suit their needs.

Note that some features of the code used in the above studies are lacking in the present version, including:
     spatially-variable advection correction
     estimation of intrinsic evolution of wind and vorticity fields

DEPENDENCIES:

   NETCDF4

   Visky software (Gordon Carrie, OU), available at http://tkgeomap.org/visky/. Only required if radar files use DORADE format; 
   otherwise, can delete/comment out ReadDORADE subroutine and DORADE header include statements in DDA.cpp.

   maproj3d.f, radarlib3d.f90 (Keith Brewster; written for Advanced Regional Prediction System). Required for mapping obs to analysis grid. Included in package.
