Gordon,
  Here is a list of all the variables that should be in the Namelist(s).  As I said before, it might be easier for the user if there is a separate input file for the variables associated with the coverage routine. I have adjusted my version of of the code in /DDA_KF/src/DDA.cpp on my mac. These variables are in addition to the ones that you have in the parameter file that I am currently using.


For the variables at the top of the program 
    anel = 1;                /* For mass conservation constraint
                       (CalcDiv):
                       0 = Boussinesq approximation;
                       1 = anelastic approximation */
    laplace = 1;            /* For smoothness constraint (CalcSmooth):
                       0 = first-order derivatives;
                       1 = second-order derivatives */

    read_dataweights = 2;        /* For weights in data constraint:
                       0 = calculate and output to file;
                       1 = read from file;
                       2 = weight all observations equally
                     */

    read_cvg = 0;            /* For dual-Doppler coverage_bg mask
                       (verification statistics computed
                       within 2+ Doppler domain only):
                       0 = calculate;
                       1 = read from file;
                       2 = don't calculate */
    min_CBA = 20;            /* dual-Doppler domain criteria:
                       minimum threshold on radar cross-beam 
                       angle (only used if read_cvg=0) */
    max_dist = 10;            /* dual-Doppler domain criteria:
                       there must be at least one obs from
                       each radar within this distance of
                       the analysis point (only used if
                       read_cvg=0)  */
    cutoff=0;                /* Optional height below which to omit
                       observations from analysis
                       (e.g., data-denial experiments) */

    UT=0; VT=0;                       /* Prescribed storm motion
                       (spatiotemporally constant) */

    output_error=0;            /* If = 1, output verification stats
                       after each iteration (see bottom of
                       CalcCost) */
                       
    weak_height=-1;     /* The index of the height equal to and below that
                        the sounding constraint is weakened inside regions 
                        with greater than 10 dbz. Set to -1 to prevent
                        implementation*/
    upper_bc=1;     /* Impose upper BC w=0 if 1, ignore if -1*/
    ITMAX2=200;     /* Number of iterations before the filtering round
    C1b = 1.0;                // data constraint
    C2b = 5.0e4;            // mass conservation equation
    C3b = 0;                // vorticity equation
    C4b = 5e6;    // horizontal smoothing
    C5b = 5e6; // vertical smoothing
    C8b = 0.01; // Sounding constraint

For the variables for the coverage routine
/* Background coverage arrays for optimal CBA*/
covo_bg011 = 1;
covo_bg101 = 1;
covo_bg110 = 1;
/* Background coverage arrays for suboptimal CBA*/

covs_bg101 = 0;
covs_bg110 = 0;
/* Filter coverage arrays for optimal CBA*/

covo_fil110 = 1;
/* Filter coverage arrays for suboptimal CBA*/

cov_bg010 = 0;
cov_bg100 = 0;
cov_fil001 = 0;
cov_fil010 = 0;

/* Data weight multiplier when all 3 radar pairs have good CBA's */
SSeq_trip1 = 1.0;
SSeq_trip2 = 1.0;
SSeq_trip3 = 0.0;
