# soschuva_hail
R and Python scripts to read and process weather radar, lightning and other data related to hailstorm cases in SOS-CHUVA Project. Part of dissertation ["Microphysics, Kinematics and Electrification in Hail Producing Tropical Storms during SOS-CHUVA Project"](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/14/14133/tde-06052019-155657/en.php) @ IAG/USP - Brazil.

***Disclaimer**: I'm still improving these scripts (specially converting from old Jupyter notebooks to sets of python scripts)*

More info about each folder can be found in each respective README.
